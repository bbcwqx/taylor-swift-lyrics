1,I've been having a hard time adjusting,158
2,"I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting",158
3,I didn't know if you'd care if I came back,158
4,I have a lot of regrets about that,158
5,Pulled the car off the road to the lookout,158
6,Could've followed my fears all the way down,158
7,And maybe I don't quite know what to say,158
8,But I'm here in your doorway,158
9,I just wanted you to know,158
10,That this is me trying,158
11,I just wanted you to know,158
12,That this is me trying,158
13,They told me all of my cages were mental,158
14,So I got wasted like all my potential,158
15,And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad,158
16,I have a lot of regrets about that,158
17,"I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere",158
18,Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here,158
19,Pourin' out my heart to a stranger,158
20,But I didn't pour the whiskey,158
21,I just wanted you to know,158
22,That this is me trying,158
23,I just wanted you to know,158
24,That this is me trying,158
25,At least I'm trying,158
26,And it's hard to be at a party,158
27,When I feel like an open wound,158
28,It's hard to be anywhere these days,158
29,When all I want is you,158
30,You're a flashback in a film reel,158
31,On the one screen in my town,158
32,And I just wanted you to know,158
33,That this is me trying (Maybe I don't quite know what to say),158
34,I just wanted you to know,158
35,That this is me trying,158
36,At least I'm trying,158
