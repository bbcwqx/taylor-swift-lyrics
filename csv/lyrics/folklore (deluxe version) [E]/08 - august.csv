1,Salt air,157
2,And the rust on your door,157
3,I never needed anything more,157
4,Whispers,157
5,"Of ""Are you sure?""",157
6,"""Never have I ever before""",157
7,But I can see us,157
8,Lost in the memory,157
9,August slipped away into a moment in time,157
10,'Cause it was never mine,157
11,And I can see us twisted in bedsheets,157
12,August sipped away,157
13,Like a bottle of wine,157
14,'Cause you were never mine,157
15,Your back,157
16,Beneath the sun,157
17,Wishing I could write my name on it,157
18,Will you call when you're back at school?,157
19,I remember thinking I had you,157
20,But I can see us,157
21,Lost in the memory,157
22,August slipped away into a moment in time,157
23,'Cause it was never mine,157
24,And I can see us twisted in bedsheets,157
25,August sipped away,157
26,Like a bottle of wine,157
27,'Cause you were never mine,157
28,Back when we were still changing for the better,157
29,Wanting was enough,157
30,"For me, it was enough",157
31,To live for the hope of it all,157
32,Cancel plans just in case you'd call,157
33,"And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""",157
34,"So much for summer love, and saying ""Us""",157
35,'Cause you weren't mine to lose,157
36,You weren't mine to lose,157
37,No,157
38,But I can see us,157
39,Lost in the memory,157
40,August slipped away into a moment in time,157
41,'Cause it was never mine,157
42,And I can see us twisted in bedsheets,157
43,August sipped away,157
44,Like a bottle of wine,157
45,"'Cause you were never mine, mine",157
46,'Cause you were never mine,157
47,Never mine,157
48,Do you remember?,157

65,And then canceled my plans,157
66,Just in case you'd call,157
67,Back when I was living for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all),157
