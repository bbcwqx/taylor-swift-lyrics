1,Please picture me in the trees,156
2,I hit my peak at seven,156
3,Feet in the swing over the creek,156
4,I was too scared to jump in,156
5,"But I, I was high in the sky",156
6,With Pennsylvania under me,156
7,Are there still beautiful things?,156
8,Sweet tea in the summer,156
9,"Cross your heart, won't tell no other",156
10,And though I can't recall your face,156
11,I still got love for you,156
12,Your braids like a pattern,156
13,Love you to the moon and to Saturn,156
14,Passed down like folk songs,156
15,The love lasts so long,156
16,And I've been meaning to tell you,156
17,I think your house is haunted,156
18,Your dad is always mad and that must be why,156
19,And I think you should come live with me,156
20,And we can be pirates,156
21,Then you won't have to cry,156
22,Or hide in the closet,156
23,And just like a folk song,156
24,Our love will be passed on,156
25,Please picture me in the weeds,156
26,Before I learned civility,156
27,I used to scream ferociously,156
28,Anytime I wanted,156
29,"I, I",156
30,Sweet tea in the summer,156
31,"Cross my heart, won't tell no other",156
32,And though I can't recall your face,156
33,I still got love for you,156
34,Pack your dolls and a sweater,156
35,We'll move to India forever,156
36,Passed down like folk songs,156
37,Our love lasts so long,156
