1,Is it romantic how all my elegies,166
2,Eulogize me?,166
3,I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones,166
4,These hunters with cell phones,166
5,"Take me to the lakes, where all the poets went to die",166
6,I don't belong,166
7,"And, my beloved, neither do you",166
8,Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry,166
9,I'm setting off,166
10,But not without my muse,166
11,What should be over,166
12,Burrowed under my skin,166
13,In heart-stopping waves of hurt,166
14,I've come too far to watch some name-dropping sleaze,166
15,"Tell me, what are my words worth?",166
16,"Take me to the lakes, where all the poets went to die",166
17,I don't belong,166
18,"And, my beloved, neither do you",166
19,Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry,166
20,I'm setting off,166
21,But not without my muse,166
22,I want auroras and sad prose,166
23,I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet,166
24,'Cause I haven't moved in years,166
25,And I want you right here,166
26,A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground,166
27,With no one around to tweet it,166
28,While I bathe in cliffside pools,166
29,With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief,166
30,"Take me to the lakes, where all the poets went to die",166
31,I don't belong,166
32,"And, my beloved, neither do you",166
33,Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry,166
34,I'm setting off,166
35,But not without my muse,166
36,"No, not without you",166
