1,We gather here,154
2,"We line up, weeping in a sunlit room",154
3,And if I'm on fire,154
4,"You'll be made of ashes, too",154
5,Even on my worst day,154
6,"Did I deserve, babe",154
7,All the hell you gave me?,154
8,'Cause I loved you,154
9,I swear I loved you,154
10,Till my dying day,154
11,I didn't have it in myself to go with grace,154
12,"And you're the hero flying around, saving face",154
13,"And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?",154
14,Cursing my name,154
15,Wishing I stayed,154
16,Look at how my tears ricochet,154
17,We gather stones,154
18,Never knowing what they'll mean,154
19,Some to throw,154
20,Some to make a diamond ring,154
21,You know I didn't want to,154
22,Have to haunt you,154
23,But what a ghostly scene,154
24,You wear the same jewels,154
25,That I gave you,154
26,As you bury me,154
27,I didn't have it in myself to go with grace,154
28,"'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave",154
29,"And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?",154
30,Cursing my name,154
31,Wishing I'd stayed,154
32,Look at how my tears ricochet,154
33,And I can go anywhere I want,154
34,Anywhere I want,154
35,Just not home,154
36,"And you can aim for my heart, go for blood",154
37,But you would still miss me in your bones,154
38,And I still talk to you,154
39,When I'm screaming at the sky,154
40,And when you can't sleep at night,154
41,You hear my stolen lullabies,154
42,I didn't have it in myself to go with grace,154
43,"And so, the battleships will sink beneath the waves",154
44,"You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same",154
45,Cursing my name,154
46,Wishing I stayed,154
47,You turned into your worst fears,154
48,And you're tossing out blame,154
49,Drunk on this pain,154
50,Crossing out the good years,154
51,And you're cursing my name,154
52,Wishing I stayed,154
53,Look at how my tears ricochet,154
