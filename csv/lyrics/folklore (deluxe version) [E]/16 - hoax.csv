1,My only one,165
2,My smoking gun,165
3,My eclipsed sun,165
4,This has broken me down,165
5,My twisted knife,165
6,My sleepless night,165
7,My winless fight,165
8,This has frozen my ground,165
9,Stood on the cliffside,165
10,"Screaming, ""Give me a reason""",165
11,Your faithless love's the only hoax,165
12,I believe in,165
13,Don't want no other shade of blue,165
14,But you,165
15,No other sadness in the world would do,165
16,My best laid plan,165
17,Your sleight of hand,165
18,My barren land,165
19,I am ash from your fire,165
20,Stood on the cliffside,165
21,"Screaming ""Give me a reason""",165
22,Your faithless love's the only hoax,165
23,I believe in,165
24,Don't want no other shade of blue,165
25,But you,165
26,No other sadness in the world would do,165
27,You know I left a part of me back in New York,165
28,"You knew the hero died, so what's the movie for",165
29,You knew it still hurts underneath my scars,165
30,From when they pulled me apart,165
31,"You knew the password, so I let you in the door",165
32,"You knew you won, so what's the point of keeping score?",165
33,You knew it still hurts underneath my scars,165
34,From when they pulled me apart,165
35,But what you did was just as dark,165
36,"Darling, this was just as hard",165
37,As when they pulled me apart,165
38,My only one,165
39,My kingdom come undone,165
40,My broken drum,165
41,You have beaten my heart,165
42,Don't want no other shade of blue,165
43,But you,165
44,No other sadness in the world would do,165
