1,Make sure nobody sees you leave,159
2,Hood over your head,159
3,Keep your eyes down,159
4,Tell your friends you're out for a run,159
5,You'll be flushed when you return,159
6,Take the road less traveled by,159
7,Tell yourself you can always stop,159
8,What started in beautiful rooms,159
9,Ends with meetings in parking lots,159
10,And that's the thing about illicit affairs,159
11,And clandestine meetings,159
12,And longing stares,159
13,It's born from just one single glance,159
14,But it dies and it dies and it dies,159
15,...a million little times,159
16,Leave the perfume on the shelf,159
17,That you picked out just for him,159
18,So you leave no trace behind,159
19,Like you don't even exist,159
20,Take the words for what they are,159
21,"A dwindling, mercurial high",159
22,A drug that only worked,159
23,The first few hundred times,159
24,And that's the thing about illicit affairs,159
25,And clandestine meetings,159
26,And stolen stares,159
27,They show their truth one single time,159
28,But they lie and they lie and they lie,159
29,...a million little times,159
30,And you wanna scream,159
31,Don't call me kid,159
32,Don't call me baby,159
33,Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me,159
34,You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else,159
35,Don't call me kid,159
36,Don't call me baby,159
37,Look at this idiotic fool that you made me,159
38,You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else,159
39,And you know damn well,159
40,For you I would ruin myself,159
41,...a million little times,159
