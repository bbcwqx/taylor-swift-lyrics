1,I want you to know,155
2,I'm a mirrorball,155
3,I'll show you every version of yourself tonight,155
4,I'll get you out on the floor,155
5,Shimmering beautiful,155
6,And when I break it's in a million pieces,155
7,Hush,155
8,"When no one is around, my dear",155
9,You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes,155
10,"Spinning in my highest heels, love",155
11,Shining just for you,155
12,Hush,155
13,I know they said the end is near,155
14,But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes,155
15,"Spinning in my highest heels, love",155
16,Shining just for you,155
17,I want you to know,155
18,I'm a mirrorball,155
19,I can change everything about me to fit in,155
20,You are not like the regulars,155
21,The masquerade revelers,155
22,Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten,155
23,Hush,155
24,"When no one is around, my dear",155
25,You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes,155
26,"Spinning in my highest heels, love",155
27,Shining just for you,155
28,Hush,155
29,I know they said the end is near,155
30,But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes,155
31,"Spinning in my highest heels, love",155
32,Shining just for you,155
33,And they called off the circus,155
34,Burned the disco down,155
35,When they sent home the horses,155
36,And the rodeo clowns,155
37,I'm still on that tightrope,155
38,I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me,155
39,I'm still a believer but I don't know why,155
40,I've never been a natural,155
41,"All I do is try, try, try",155
42,I'm still on that trapeze,155
43,I'm still trying everything,155
44,To keep you looking at me,155
45,Because I'm a mirrorball,155
46,I'm a mirrorball,155
47,I'll show you every version of yourself,155
48,Tonight,155
