1,Green was the color of the grass where I used to read at Centennial Park,160
2,I used to think I would meet somebody there,160
3,Teal was the color of your shirt when you were sixteen at the yogurt shop,160
4,You used to work at to make a little money,160
5,Time,160
6,Curious time,160
7,Gave me no compasses,160
8,Gave me no signs,160
9,Were there clues I didn't see?,160
10,And isn't it just so pretty to think,160
11,All along there was some,160
12,Invisible string,160
13,Tying you to me?,160
14,Bad was the blood of the song in the cab on your first trip to LA,160
15,You ate at my favorite spot for dinner,160
16,Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip getting lunch down by the Lakes,160
17,She said I looked like an American singer,160
18,Time,160
19,Mystical time,160
20,"Cutting me open, then healing me fine",160
21,Were there clues I didn't see?,160
22,And isn't it just so pretty to think,160
23,All along there was some,160
24,Invisible string,160
25,Tying you to me?,160
26,A string that pulled me,160
27,"Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar",160
28,Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire,160
29,Chains around my demons,160
30,Wool to brave the seasons,160
31,One single thread of gold tied me to you,160
32,Cold was the steel of my axe to grind for the boys who broke my heart,160
33,"Now, I send their babies presents",160
34,Gold was the color of the leaves when I showed you around Centennial Park,160
35,"Hell was the journey, but it brought me heaven",160
36,Time,160
37,Wondrous time,160
38,"Gave me the blues and then, purple-pink skies",160
39,And it's cool,160
40,"Baby, with me",160
41,And isn't it just so pretty to think,160
42,All along there was some,160
43,Invisible string,160
44,Tying you to me?,160
