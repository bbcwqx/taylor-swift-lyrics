1,"I can see you standing, honey",153
2,With his arms around your body,153
3,Laughing but the joke's not funny at all,153
4,And it took you five whole minutes,153
5,To pack us up and leave me with it,153
6,Holding all this love out here in the hall,153
7,I think I've seen this film before,153
8,And I didn't like the ending,153
9,You're not my homeland anymore,153
10,So what am I defending now?,153
11,You were my town,153
12,Now I'm in exile seeing you out,153
13,I think I've seen this film before,153
14,"I can see you staring, honey",153
15,Like he's just your understudy,153
16,Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me,153
17,"Second, third, and hundredth chances",153
18,Balancing on breaking branches,153
19,Those eyes add insult to injury,153
20,I think I've seen this film before,153
21,And I didn't like the ending,153
22,I'm not your problem anymore,153
23,So who am I offending now?,153
24,You were my crown,153
25,Now I'm in exile seeing you out,153
26,I think I've seen this film before,153
27,So I'm leaving out the side door,153
28,So step right out,153
29,There is no amount,153
30,Of crying I can do for you,153
31,All this time,153
32,We always walked a very thin line,153
33,You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out),153
34,You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs),153
35,All this time,153
36,I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind),153
37,I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around),153
38,'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs),153
39,So many signs,153
40,So many signs (You didn't even see the signs),153
41,I think I've seen this film before,153
42,And I didn't like the ending,153
43,You're not my homeland anymore,153
44,So what am I defending now?,153
45,You were my town,153
46,Now I'm in exile seeing you out,153

50,There is no amount,153
51,Of crying I can do for you,153
52,All this time,153
53,We always walked a very thin line,153
54,You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out),153
