1,Flashing lights and we,108
2,"Took a wrong turn, and we",108
3,Fell down a rabbit hole,108
4,You held on tight to me,108
5,'Cause nothing's as it seems,108
6,And spinning out of control,108
7,"Didn't they tell us, ""Don't rush into things""?",108
8,Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?,108
9,Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?,108
10,"Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?",108
11,I felt your arms twisting around me,108
12,I should've slept with one eye open at night,108
13,We found Wonderland,108
14,You and I got lost in it,108
15,"And we pretended it could last forever, eh-eh",108
16,We found Wonderland,108
17,You and I got lost in it,108
18,"And life was never worse but never better, eh-eh",108
19,"Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland",108
20,"Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland",108
21,"Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland",108
22,"Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland",108
23,So we went on our way,108
24,Too in love to think straight,108
25,"All alone, or so it seemed",108
26,But there were strangers watching,108
27,And whispers turned to talking,108
28,"And talking turned to screams, oh",108
29,"Didn't they tell us, ""Don't rush into things""?",108
30,Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?,108
31,Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire Cat smile?,108
32,"Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?",108
33,I felt your arms twisting around me,108
34,It's all fun and games till somebody loses their mind,108
35,"Oh, darling",108
36,We found Wonderland,108
37,You and I got lost in it,108
38,"And we pretended it could last forever, eh-eh",108
39,We found Wonderland,108
40,You and I got lost in it,108
41,"And life was never worse but never better, eh-eh",108
42,"Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland",108
43,"Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland",108
44,"Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland",108
45,"Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland",108
46,"I reached for you, but you were gone",108
47,I knew I had to go back home,108
48,You searched the world for something else,108
49,To make you feel like what we had,108
50,"And in the end, in Wonderland, we both went mad, oh",108
51,We found Wonderland,108
52,You and I got lost in it,108
53,"And we pretended it could last forever, eh-eh (Could last forever)",108
54,We found Wonderland,108
55,You and I got lost in it (Got lost in it),108
56,"And life was never worse but never better, eh-eh (Never better)",108
57,We found Wonderland,108
58,You and I got lost in it (In Wonderland),108
59,And we pretended it could last forever (In Wonderland),108
60,We found Wonderland,108
61,You and I got lost in it (In Wonderland),108
62,And life was never worse but never better (In Wonderland),108
