1,Once the flight had flown,115
2,With the wilt of the rose,115
3,I slept all alone,115
4,You still wouldn't go,115
5,Let's fast forward to 300 takeout coffees later,115
6,I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters,115
7,You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor,115
8,You search in every maiden's bed for something greater,115
9,"Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch?",115
10,Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?,115
11,"""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear in your dream as you passed out",115
12,"Baby, was it over then?",115
13,And is it over now?,115
14,When you lost control,115
15,"Red blood, white snow",115
16,Blue dress on a boat,115
17,Your new girl is my clone,115
18,And did you think I didn't see you? There were flashing lights,115
19,At least I had the decency to keep my nights out of sight,115
20,"Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs, and my whispered sighs",115
21,"Oh Lord, I think about jumping",115
22,Off of very tall somethings,115
23,Just to see you come running,115
24,And say the one thing I've been wanting,115
25,But no!,115
26,Let's fast forward to 300 awkward blind dates later,115
27,"If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her",115
28,You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor,115
29,You search in every model's bed for something greater,115
30,"Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch?",115
31,Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?,115
32,"""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear in your dream as you passed out",115
33,"Baby, was it over then?",115
34,And is it over now?,115
35,Think I didn't see you? There were flashing lights,115
36,At least I had the decency to keep my nights out of sight,115
37,"Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs, and my whispered sighs",115
38,"Oh Lord, I think about jumping",115
39,Off of very tall somethings,115
40,Just to see you come running (Running),115
41,And say the one thing I've been wanting,115
42,But no!,115
43,"(Flashing lights, oh Lord) Let's fast forward to 300 takeout coffees later",115
44,(Flashing lights) I was hoping you'd be there,115
45,"And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no (Oh Lord, oh Lord)",115
