1,You had people who called you on unmarked numbers,114
2,In my peripheral vision,114
3,I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer,114
4,All was quickly forgiven,114
5,"You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious",114
6,Flush with the currency of cool,114
7,I was always turning out my empty pockets,114
8,And when it came to you,114
9,I didn't come here to make friends,114
10,We were born to be suburban legends,114
11,"When you hold me, it holds me together",114
12,And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever,114
13,I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs,114
14,Would surprise the whole school,114
15,When I ended up back at our class reunion,114
16,Walking in with you,114
17,You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries,114
18,With the pages ripped out,114
19,I am standing in a 1950s gymnasium,114
20,And I can still see you now,114
21,I didn't come here to make friends,114
22,We were born to be suburban legends,114
23,"When you hold me, it holds me together",114
24,And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever,114
25,I know that you still remember,114
26,We were born to be national treasures,114
27,When you told me we'd get back together,114
28,And you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever,114
29,"Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block",114
30,I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it,114
31,"Waves crash on the shore, I dash to the door",114
32,"You don't knock anymore, and my whole life's ruined",114
33,"Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block",114
34,I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it,114
35,"Waves crash to the shore, I dash to the door",114
36,"You don't knock anymore, and I always knew it",114
37,That my life would be ruined,114
