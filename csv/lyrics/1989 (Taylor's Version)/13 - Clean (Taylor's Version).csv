1,The drought was the very worst,107
2,"Ah-ah, ah-ah",107
3,When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst,107
4,"It was months, and months of back and forth",107
5,"Ah-ah, ah-ah",107
6,You're still all over me,107
7,Like a wine stained dress I can't wear anymore,107
8,Hung my head as I lost the war,107
9,And the sky turned black like a perfect storm,107
10,The rain came pouring down when I was drowning,107
11,That's when I could finally breathe,107
12,"And by morning, gone was any trace of you",107
13,I think I am finally clean,107
14,There was nothing left to do,107
15,"Ah-ah, ah-ah",107
16,When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room,107
17,So I punched a hole in the roof,107
18,"Ah-ah, ah-ah",107
19,Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you,107
20,"The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud",107
21,But no one heard a thing,107
22,The rain came pouring down when I was drowning,107
23,That's when I could finally breathe,107
24,"And by morning, gone was any trace of you",107
25,I think I am finally clean,107
26,I think I am finally clean,107
27,"Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah",107
28,"Said, I think I am finally clean",107
29,Ah-ah-ah,107
30,"Ten months sober, I must admit",107
31,Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it,107
32,"Ten months older, I won't give in",107
33,Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it,107
34,The drought was the very worst,107
35,"Ah-ah, ah-ah",107
36,When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst,107
37,The rain came pouring down when I was drowning,107
38,That's when I could finally breathe,107
39,"And by morning, gone was any trace of you",107
40,I think I am finally clean,107
41,The rain came pouring down when I was drowning,107
42,That's when I could finally breathe,107
43,"And by morning, gone was any trace of you",107
44,I think I am finally clean,107
45,Finally clean,107
46,Think I'm finally clean,107
47,"Ah-ah, ah-ah",107
48,Think I'm finally clean,107
