1,Once I had an empire in a golden age,61
2,"I was held up so high, I used to be great",61
3,They used to cheer when they saw my face,61
4,"Now I fear, I have fallen from grace",61
5,And I feel like my castle's crumbling down,61
6,And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground,61
7,And you don't want to know me,61
8,I will just let you down,61
9,You don't wanna know me now,61
10,"Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty",61
11,Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me,61
12,Their faith was strong,61
13,But I pushed it too far,61
14,I held that grudge,61
15,Till it tore me apart,61
16,Power went to my head and I couldn't stop,61
17,"Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off",61
18,"And here I sit alone, behind walls of regret",61
19,Falling down like promises that I never kept,61
20,And I feel like my castle's crumbling down,61
21,And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground,61
22,And you don't want to know me,61
23,I will just let you down,61
24,You don't wanna know me now,61
25,My foes and friends watch my reign end,61
26,I don't know how it could've ended this way,61
27,Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor,61
28,People look at me like I'm a monster,61
29,Now they're screaming at the palace front gates,61
30,Used to chant my name,61
31,Now they're screaming that they hate me,61
32,Never wanted you to hate me,61
33,My castle's crumbling down,61
34,And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground,61
35,And you don't want to know me,61
36,I will just let you down,61
37,My castle's crumbling down,61
38,You don't wanna know me now-ow,61
