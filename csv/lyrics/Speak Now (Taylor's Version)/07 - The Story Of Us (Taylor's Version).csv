1,I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,48
2,How we met and the sparks flew instantly,48
3,"And people would say, ""They're the lucky ones""",48
4,I used to know my place was the spot next to you,48
5,Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat,48
6,"'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on",48
7,"Oh, a simple complication, miscommunications lead to fallout",48
8,So many things that I wish you knew,48
9,So many walls up I can't break through,48
10,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,48
11,"And I'm dying to know, is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah",48
12,I don't know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down,48
13,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now,48
14,Next chapter,48
15,How'd we end up this way?,48
16,See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy,48
17,And you're doing your best to avoid me,48
18,"I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us",48
19,How I was losing my mind when I saw you here,48
20,But you held your pride like you should've held me,48
21,"Oh, I'm scared to see the ending, why are we pretending this is nothing?",48
22,"I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how",48
23,I've never heard silence quite this loud,48
24,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,48
25,"And I'm dying to know, is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah",48
26,I don't know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down,48
27,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now,48
28,This is looking like a contest of who can act like they care less,48
29,But I liked it better when you were on my side,48
30,The battle's in your hands now,48
31,But I would lay my armor down if you said you'd rather love than fight,48
32,So many things that you wish I knew,48
33,But the story of us might be ending soon,48
34,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking,48
35,"And I'm dying to know, is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah",48
36,I don't know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down,48
37,"And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now",48
38,And we're not speaking,48
39,"And I'm dying to know, is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah",48
40,I don't know what to say since the twist of fate 'cause we're goin' down,48
41,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now,48
42,The end,48
