1,I guess you really did it this time,52
2,Left yourself in your war path,52
3,Lost your balance on a tightrope,52
4,Lost your mind trying to get it back,52
5,Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?,52
6,Always a bigger bed to crawl into,52
7,Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything,52
8,And everybody believed in you?,52
9,"It's alright, just wait and see, your string of lights is still bright to me, oh",52
10,Who you are is not where you've been,52
11,You're still an innocent,52
12,You're still an innocent,52
13,Did some things you can't speak of,52
14,"But at night, you live it all again",52
15,You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now,52
16,If only you had seen what you know now then,52
17,Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days,52
18,When everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you?,52
19,Wasn't it beautiful running wild till you fell asleep,52
20,Before the monsters caught up to you?,52
21,"It's alright, just wait and see, your string of lights is still bright to me, oh",52
22,Who you are is not where you've been,52
23,You're still an innocent,52
24,"It's okay, life is a tough crowd",52
25,Thirty-two and still growing up now,52
26,Who you are is not what you did,52
27,You're still an innocent,52
28,Time turns flames to embers,52
29,You'll have new Septembers,52
30,"Every one of us has messed up, too",52
31,Ooh,52
32,Minds change like the weather,52
33,I hope you remember,52
34,Today is never too late to,52
35,Be brand new,52
36,Oh,52
37,"It's alright, just wait and see, your string of lights is still bright to me, oh",52
38,Who you are is not where you've been,52
39,You're still an innocent,52
40,"It's okay, life is a tough crowd",52
41,Thirty-two and still growing up now,52
42,Who you are is not what you did,52
43,You're still an innocent,52
44,You're still an innocent,52
45,"Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh",52
46,It's never too late to get it back,52
