2,He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away,57
3,To save the world or go to work,57
4,It's the same thing to me,57
5,He's got his mother's eyes,57
6,His father's ambition,57
7,I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him,57
8,I hang on every word you say,57
9,"And you'll smile and say, ""How are you?""",57

21,"He's complicated, he's irrational",57
22,But I hope someday he'll take me away,57
23,"And save the day, yeah",57
24,Something in his deep brown eyes has me saying,57
25,He's not all bad like his reputation,57
26,And I can't hear one single word they say,57
27,"And you'll leave, got places to be",57
28,And I'll be okay,57

37,When you come back down,57
38,And I watch you fly around the world,57
39,And I hope you don't save some other girl,57
40,"Don't forget, don't forget about me",57
41,"I'm far away, but I never let you go",57

56,When you come back down,57
57,When you come back down,57
