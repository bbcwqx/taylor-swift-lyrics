1,"You were in college, working part time, waiting tables",42
2,"Left a small town, never looked back",42
3,I was a flight risk with a fear of falling,42
4,Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts,42
5,"I say, ""Can you believe it?""",42
6,As we're lying on the couch,42
7,The moment I can see it,42
8,"Yes, yes",42
9,I can see it now,42
10,Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?,42
11,You put your arm around me for the first time,42
12,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter,42
13,You are the best thing that's ever been mine,42
14,Flash forward and we're taking on the world together,42
15,And there's a drawer of my things at your place,42
16,"You learn my secrets, and you figure out why I'm guarded",42
17,You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes,42
18,But we got bills to pay,42
19,We got nothing figured out,42
20,When it was hard to take,42
21,"Yes, yes",42
22,This is what I thought about,42
23,Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?,42
24,You put your arm around me for the first time,42
25,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter,42
26,You are the best thing that's ever been mine,42
27,Do you remember all the city lights on the water?,42
28,"You saw me start to believe, for the first time",42
29,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter,42
30,You are the best thing that's ever been mine,42
31,"Oh, oh, oh",42
32,"And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM",42
33,As everything was slipping right out of our hands,42
34,"I ran out crying, and you followed me out into the street",42
35,Braced myself for the goodbye,42
36,'Cause it's all I've ever known,42
37,And you took me by surprise,42
38,"You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""",42
39,"You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water",42
40,"And every time I look at you, it's like the first time",42
41,I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter,42
42,"She is the best thing that's ever been mine""",42
43,Hold on and make it last,42
44,"Hold on, never turn back",42
45,(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter,42
46,(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine,42
47,Do you believe it?,42
48,We're gonna make it now,42
49,And I can see it,42
50,I can see it now,42
