3,"Just the first time ever hanging out with you, tonight",58
4,I've got my money on things going badly,58
5,Got a history of stories ending sadly,58
6,Still hoping that the fire won't burn me,58
7,Just one time,58
8,Just one time,58
9,All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life,58
10,Got a feeling your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life,58
11,And I want you now,58
12,Want to need you forever,58
13,In the heat of your electric touch,58
14,"Mmm, mmm",58
15,"I've been left in the rain, lost and pining",58

19,I've grown accustomed to sleeping alone,58
20,Still I know that all it takes is to get it right,58

22,Just one time,58
23,All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life,58

26,Want to need you forever,58
27,In the heat of your electric touch,58

29,Maybe the stars align (Just one time),58
30,And maybe I call you mine,58
31,And you won't need space,58
32,Or string me along while you decide,58
33,And just one time (Just one time),58
34,Maybe the moment's right (Moment's right),58
35,It's 8:05,58
36,And I see two headlights,58
37,All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life,58
38,Got a feeling your electric touch,58
39,All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life,58
40,Got a feeling your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life,58
41,And I want you now,58
42,Want to need you forever,58
43,In the heat of your electric touch,58
44,"Mmm, mmm, mmm",58
