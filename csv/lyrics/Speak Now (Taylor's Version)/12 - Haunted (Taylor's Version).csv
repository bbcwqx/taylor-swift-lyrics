1,You and I walk a fragile line,53
2,I have known it all this time,53
3,But I never thought I'd live to see it break,53
4,"It's getting dark and it's all so quiet, and I can't trust anything now",53
5,And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake,53
6,"Oh, holding my breath",53
7,Won't lose you again,53
8,Something's made your eyes go cold,53
9,"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this",53
10,I thought I had you figured out,53
11,Something's gone terribly wrong,53
12,You're all I wanted,53
13,"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this",53
14,I thought I had you figured out,53
15,Can't breathe whenever you're gone,53
16,"Can't turn back now, I'm haunted",53
17,Stood there and watched you walk away from everything we had,53
18,But I still mean every word I said to you,53
19,He will try to take away my pain,53
20,And he just might make me smile,53
21,"But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead",53
22,"Oh, holding my breath",53
23,Won't see you again,53
24,Something keeps me holding onto nothing,53
25,"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this",53
26,I thought I had you figured out,53
27,Something's gone terribly wrong,53
28,You're all I wanted,53
29,"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this",53
30,I thought I had you figured out,53
31,Can't breathe whenever you're gone,53
32,"Can't turn back now, I'm haunted",53
33,"I know, I know",53
34,I just know,53
35,You're not gone,53
36,"You can't be gone, no",53
37,"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this",53
38,I thought I had you figured out,53
39,Something's gone terribly wrong,53
40,Won't finish what you started,53
41,"Come on, come on, don't leave me like this",53
42,I thought I had you figured out,53
43,Can't breathe whenever you're gone,53
44,"I can't go back, I'm haunted",53
45,"Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh",53
46,You and I walk a fragile line,53
47,I have known it all this time,53
48,"Never, ever thought I'd see it break",53
49,Never thought I'd see it,53
