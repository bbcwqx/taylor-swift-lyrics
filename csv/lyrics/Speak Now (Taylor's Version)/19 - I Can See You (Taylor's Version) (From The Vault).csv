1,You brush past me in the hallway,60
2,"And you don't think I, I, I can see you, do you?",60
3,I've been watching you for ages,60
4,And I spend my time trying not to feel it,60
5,But what would you do,60
6,If I went to touch you now?,60
7,What would you do,60
8,If they never found us out?,60
9,What would you do,60
10,If we never made a sound?,60
11,'Cause I can see you,60
12,Waiting down the hall from me,60
13,And I could see you,60
14,Up against the wall with me,60
15,And what would you do,60
16,"Baby, if you only knew?",60
17,That I can see you,60
18,And we kept everything professional,60
19,"But something's changed, it's something I, I like",60
20,They keep watchful eyes on us,60
21,So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet,60
22,You won't believe half the things I see inside my head,60
23,Wait till you see half the things that haven't happened yet,60
24,But what would you do,60
25,If I went to touch you now?,60
26,What would you do,60
27,If they never found us out?,60
28,What would you do,60
29,If we never made a sound?,60
30,'Cause I can see you,60
31,Waiting down the hall from me,60
32,I could see you,60
33,Up against the wall with me,60
34,And what would you do,60
35,"Baby, if you only knew?",60
36,"Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh",60
37,That I can see you,60
38,Throw your jacket on the floor,60
39,I could see you,60
40,Make me want you even more,60
41,What would you do,60
42,"Baby, if you only knew?",60
43,That I can see you,60
44,I could see you,60
45,In your suit and your necktie,60
46,Pass me a note,60
47,"Saying, ""Meet me tonight""",60
48,Then we kiss,60
49,"And you know I won't ever tell, yeah",60
50,And I could see you,60
51,Being my addiction,60
52,You can see me,60
53,As a secret mission,60
54,Hide away and I will start behaving myself,60
55,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, I could see you",60
56,Waiting down the hall from me,60
57,And I could see you,60
58,Up against the wall with me,60
59,And what would you do,60
60,"Baby, if you only know?",60
61,And I could see you,60
62,Throw your jacket on the floor,60
63,I could see you,60
64,Make me want you even more,60
65,What would you do,60
66,"Baby, if you only knew?",60
67,"That I can see you, oh",60
68,I can see you,60
69,"I see you, I see you, baby",60
70,I see you,60
71,"I see you, I see you, baby",60
72,"Oh, baby",60
