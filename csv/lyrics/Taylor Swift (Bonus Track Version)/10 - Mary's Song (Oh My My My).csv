1,"She said, ""I was seven and you were nine",10
2,I looked at you like the stars that shined,10
3,"In the sky, the pretty lights",10
4,And our daddies used to joke about the two of us,10
5,Growing up and falling in love,10
6,And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes,10
7,"And said, 'Oh my, my, my'",10
8,Take me back to the house in the backyard tree,10
9,"Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me",10
10,"You never did, you never did",10
11,Take me back when our world was one block wide,10
12,I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried,10
13,"Just two kids, you and I",10
14,"Oh my, my, my, my",10
15,"Well, I was sixteen when suddenly",10
16,I wasn't that little girl you used to see,10
17,But your eyes still shined like pretty lights,10
18,And our daddies used to joke about the two of us,10
19,They never believed we'd really fall in love,10
20,And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes,10
21,"And said, 'Oh my, my, my'",10
22,Take me back to the creek beds we turned up,10
23,"2 a.m., riding in your truck",10
24,And all I need is you next to me,10
25,Take me back to the time we had our very first fight,10
26,The slamming of doors 'stead of kissing goodnight,10
27,You stayed outside till the morning light,10
28,"Oh my, my, my, my",10
29,A few years had gone and come around,10
30,We were sitting at our favorite spot in town,10
31,"And you looked at me, got down on one knee",10
32,Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle,10
33,Our whole town came and our mamas cried,10
34,"You said, 'I do,' and I did too",10
35,"Take me home, where we met so many years before",10
36,We'll rock our babies on that very front porch,10
37,"After all this time, you and I",10
38,"And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine",10
39,I'll still look at you like the stars that shine,10
40,"In the sky, oh my, my, my""",10
