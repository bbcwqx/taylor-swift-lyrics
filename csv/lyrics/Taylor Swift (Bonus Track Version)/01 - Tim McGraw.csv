1,He said the way my blue eyes shined,1
2,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night,1
3,"I said, ""That's a lie""",1
4,Just a boy in a Chevy truck,1
5,That had a tendency of gettin' stuck,1
6,On backroads at night,1
7,And I was right there beside him all summer long,1
8,And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone,1
9,But when you think Tim McGraw,1
10,I hope you think my favorite song,1
11,The one we danced to all night long,1
12,The moon like a spotlight on the lake,1
13,When you think happiness,1
14,I hope you think that little black dress,1
15,Think of my head on your chest,1
16,And my old faded blue jeans,1
17,When you think Tim McGraw,1
18,I hope you think of me,1
19,September saw a month of tears,1
20,And thankin' God that you weren't here,1
21,To see me like that,1
22,But in a box beneath my bed,1
23,Is a letter that you never read,1
24,From three summers back,1
25,It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet,1
26,"And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe",1
27,When you think Tim McGraw,1
28,I hope you think my favorite song,1
29,The one we danced to all night long,1
30,The moon like a spotlight on the lake,1
31,When you think happiness,1
32,I hope you think that little black dress,1
33,Think of my head on your chest,1
34,And my old faded blue jeans,1
35,When you think Tim McGraw,1
36,I hope you think of me,1
37,And I'm back for the first time since then,1
38,I'm standin' on your street,1
39,And there's a letter left on your doorstep,1
40,And the first thing that you'll read is,1
41,When you think Tim McGraw,1
42,I hope you think my favorite song,1
43,Someday you'll turn your radio on,1
44,I hope it takes you back to that place,1
45,When you think happiness,1
46,I hope you think that little black dress,1
47,Think of my head on your chest,1
48,And my old faded blue jeans,1
49,When you think Tim McGraw,1
50,I hope you think of me,1
51,"Oh, think of me",1
52,He said the way my blue eyes shined,1
53,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night,1
54,"I said, ""That's a lie""",1
