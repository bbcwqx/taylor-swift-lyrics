1,Friday night beneath the stars,12
2,In a field behind your yard,12
3,You and I are paintin' pictures in the sky,12
4,And sometimes we don't say a thing,12
5,Just listen to the crickets sing,12
6,Everything I need is right here by my side,12
7,And I know everything about you,12
8,I don't wanna live without you,12
9,I'm only up when you're not down,12
10,Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground,12
11,It's like no matter what I do,12
12,"Well, you drive me crazy half the time",12
13,The other half I'm only trying,12
14,To let you know that what I feel is true,12
15,And I'm only me when I'm with you,12
16,Just a small town boy and girl,12
17,Livin' in a crazy world,12
18,Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true,12
19,And I don't try to hide my tears,12
20,The secrets or my deepest fears,12
21,Through it all nobody gets me like you do,12
22,And you know everything about me,12
23,You say that you can't live without me,12
24,I'm only up when you're not down,12
25,Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground,12
26,It's like no matter what I do,12
27,"Well, you drive me crazy half the time",12
28,The other half I'm only trying,12
29,To let you know that what I feel is true,12
30,And I'm only me when I'm with you,12
31,When I'm with anybody else,12
32,It's so hard to be myself,12
33,And only you can tell,12
34,That I'm only up when you're not down,12
35,Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground,12
36,It's like no matter what I do,12
37,"Well, you drive me crazy half the time",12
38,The other half I'm only trying,12
39,To let you know that what I feel is true,12
40,And I'm only me who I wanna be,12
41,"Well, I'm only me when I'm with you",12
42,"With you, oh yeah",12
