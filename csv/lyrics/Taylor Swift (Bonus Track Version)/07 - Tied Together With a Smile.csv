1,Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty,7
2,Is the face in the mirror looking back at you,7
3,You walk around here thinking you're not pretty,7
4,But that's not true,7
5,Cause I know you,7
6,"Hold on, baby, you're losing it",7
7,"The water's high, you're jumping into it",7
8,"And letting go, and no one knows",7
9,"That you cry, but you don't tell anyone",7
10,That you might not be the golden one,7
11,And you're tied together with a smile,7
12,"But you're coming undone, oh",7
13,I guess it's true that love was all you wanted,7
14,'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change,7
15,Hoping it will end up in his pocket,7
16,But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain,7
17,"Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay",7
18,It's not his price to pay,7
19,"Hold on, baby, you're losing it",7
20,"The water's high, you're jumping into it",7
21,"And letting go, and no one knows",7
22,"That you cry, but you don't tell anyone",7
23,That you might not be the golden one,7
24,And you're tied together with a smile,7
25,"But you're coming undone, oh",7
26,"Oh, oh-oh",7
27,"Hold on, baby, you're losing it",7
28,"The water's high, you're jumping into it",7
29,"And letting go, and no one knows",7
30,"That you cry, but you don't tell anyone",7
31,That you might not be the golden one,7
32,And you're tied together with a smile,7
33,"But you're coming undone, oh",7
34,You're tied together with a smile,7
35,"But you're coming undone, oh",7
36,"Goodbye, baby",7
37,"With a smile, baby, baby, oh",7
