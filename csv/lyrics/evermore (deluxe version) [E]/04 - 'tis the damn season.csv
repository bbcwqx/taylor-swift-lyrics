1,If I wanted to know,170
2,Who you were hanging with while I was gone,170
3,I would've asked you,170
4,It's the kind of cold,170
5,Fogs up windshield glass,170
6,But I felt it when I passed you,170
7,There's an ache in you,170
8,Put there by the ache in me,170
9,But if it's all the same to you,170
10,It's the same to me,170
11,So we could call it even,170
12,"You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend",170
13,'Tis the damn season,170
14,Write this down,170
15,I'm staying at my parents' house,170
16,And the road not taken looks real good now,170
17,And it always leads to you and my hometown,170
18,I parked my car right between The Methodist,170
19,And the school that used to be ours,170
20,The holidays linger like bad perfume,170
21,You can run but only so far,170
22,I escaped it too,170
23,Remember how you watched me leave,170
24,But if it's okay with you,170
25,It's okay with me,170
26,We could call it even,170
27,"You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend",170
28,'Tis the damn season,170
29,Write this down,170
30,I'm staying at my parents' house,170
31,And the road not taken looks real good now,170
32,Time flies,170
33,Messy as the mud on your truck tires,170
34,Now I'm missing your smile,170
35,Hear me out,170
36,We could just ride around,170
37,And the road not taken looks real good now,170
38,And it always leads to you,170
39,And my hometown,170
40,Sleep in half the day,170
41,Just for old times' sake,170
42,I won't ask you to wait,170
43,If you don't ask me to stay,170
44,So I'll go back to LA and the so-called friends,170
45,Who'll write books about me if I ever make it,170
46,And wonder about the only soul,170
47,Who can tell which smiles I'm faking,170
48,And the heart I know I'm breaking,170
49,Is my own,170
50,To leave the warmest bed I've ever known,170
51,We could call it even,170
52,Even though I'm leaving,170
53,And I'll be yours for the weekend,170
54,'Tis the damn season...,170
55,We could call it even,170
56,"You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend",170
57,'Tis the damn season,170
58,Write this down,170
59,I'm staying at my parents' house,170
60,And the road not taken looks real good now,170
61,Time flies,170
62,Messy as the mud on your truck tires,170
63,Now I'm missing your smile,170
64,Hear me out,170
65,We could just ride around,170
66,And the road not taken looks real good now,170
67,And it always leads to you,170
68,And my hometown,170
69,And it always leads to you and my hometown,170
