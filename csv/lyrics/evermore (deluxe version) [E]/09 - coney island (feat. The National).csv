1,Break my soul in two,175
2,"Looking for you, but you're right here",175
3,If I can't relate to you anymore,175
4,Then who am I related to?,175
5,And if this is the long haul,175
6,How'd we get here so soon?,175
7,Did I close my fist around something delicate?,175
8,Did I shatter you?,175

14,"Disappointments, close your eyes",175
15,And it gets colder and colder,175
16,When the sun goes down,175
17,The question pounds my head,175
18,"""What's a lifetime of achievement?""",175
19,If I pushed you to the edge,175
20,But you were too polite to leave me,175
21,And do you miss the rogue,175
22,Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?,175
23,Will you forgive my soul,175
24,When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?,175

27,"The mischief, the gift wrapped suburban dreams",175
28,Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring,175
29,Over and over,175
30,Lost again with no surprises,175
31,"Disappointments, close your eyes",175
32,And it gets colder and colder,175
33,When the sun goes down,175
34,Were you waiting at our old spot,175
35,"In the tree line, by the gold clock",175
36,Did I leave you hanging every single day?,175
37,Were you standing in the hallway,175
38,"With a big cake, happy birthday",175
39,Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest gray?,175
40,A universe away,175
41,And when I got into the accident,175
42,The sight that flashed before me was your face,175
43,But when I walked up to the podium,175
44,I think that I forgot to say your name,175
45,"I'm on a bench in Coney Island, wondering where did my baby go?",175
46,"The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go",175
47,Sorry for not making you my centerfold,175
48,Over and over,175
49,Lost again with no surprises,175
50,"Disappointments, close your eyes",175
51,And it gets colder and colder,175
52,When the sun goes down,175
53,When the sun goes down,175
54,The sight that flashed before me was your face,175
55,When the sun goes down,175
56,But I think that I forgot to say your name,175
57,Over and over,175
58,Sorry for not making you my,175
59,Making you my,175
60,Making you my centerfold,175
