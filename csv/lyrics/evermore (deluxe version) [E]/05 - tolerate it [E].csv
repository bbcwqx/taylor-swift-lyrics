1,I sit and watch you reading with your,171
2,Head low,171
3,I wake and watch you breathing with your,171
4,Eyes closed,171
5,I sit and watch you,171
6,I notice everything you do or don't do,171
7,You're so much older and wiser and I,171
8,I wait by the door like I'm just a kid,171
9,Use my best colors for your portrait,171
10,Lay the table with the fancy shit,171
11,And watch you tolerate it,171
12,If it's all in my head tell me now,171
13,Tell me I've got it wrong somehow,171
14,I know my love should be celebrated,171
15,But you tolerate it,171
16,I greet you with a battle hero's welcome,171
17,I take your indiscretions all in good fun,171
18,I sit and listen,171
19,I polish plates until they gleam and glisten,171
20,You're so much older and wiser and I,171
21,I wait by the door like I'm just a kid,171
22,Use my best colors for your portrait,171
23,Lay the table with the fancy shit,171
24,And watch you tolerate it,171
25,If it's all in my head tell me now,171
26,Tell me I've got it wrong somehow,171
27,I know my love should be celebrated,171
28,But you tolerate it,171
29,"While you were out building other worlds, where was I?",171
30,Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?,171
31,"I made you my temple, my mural, my sky",171
32,Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life,171
33,Drawing hearts in the byline,171
34,Always taking up too much space or time,171
35,"You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I",171
36,Break free and leave us in ruins,171
37,Took this dagger in me and removed it,171
38,Gain the weight of you then lose it,171
39,"Believe me, I could do it",171
40,If it's all in my head tell me now,171
41,Tell me I've got it wrong somehow,171
42,I know my love should be celebrated,171
43,But you tolerate it,171
44,I sit and watch you,171
