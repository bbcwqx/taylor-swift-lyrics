1,Gleaming,169
2,Twinkling,169
3,Eyes like sinking,169
4,Ships on waters,169
5,So inviting,169
6,I almost jump in,169
7,"I don't like a gold rush, gold rush",169
8,I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush,169
9,I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch,169
10,Everybody wants you,169
11,Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you,169
12,"Walk past, quick brush",169
13,"I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush",169
14,I don't like that falling feels like flying till the bone crush,169
15,Everybody wants you,169
16,But I don't like a gold rush,169
17,What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?,169
18,With your hair falling into place like dominos,169
19,I see me padding 'cross your wooden floors,169
20,With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door,169
21,At dinner parties I call you out on your contrarian shit,169
22,And the coastal town we wandered 'round had never seen a love as pure as it,169
23,And then it fades into the gray of my day old tea,169
24,'Cause it could never be,169
25,"'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush",169
26,I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush,169
27,I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch,169
28,Everybody wants you,169
29,Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you,169
30,"Walk past, quick brush",169
31,"I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush",169
32,I don't like that falling feels like flying till the bone crush,169
33,Everybody wants you,169
34,But I don't like a gold rush,169
35,What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?,169
36,With your hair falling into place like dominos,169
37,My mind turns your life into folklore,169
38,I can't dare to dream about you anymore,169
39,At dinner parties I won't call you out on your contrarian shit,169
40,And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it,169
41,'Cause it fades into the gray of my day old tea,169
42,'Cause it will never be,169
43,Gleaming,169
44,Twinkling,169
45,Eyes like sinking,169
46,Ships on waters,169
47,So inviting,169
48,I almost jump in,169
