1,And the tennis court was covered up,177
2,With some tent-like thing,177
3,And you asked me to dance,177
4,"But I said, ""dancing is a dangerous game""",177
5,"Oh, I thought",177
6,This is gonna be one of those things,177
7,Now I know,177
8,I'm never gonna love again,177
9,I've got some tricks up my sleeve,177
10,Takes one to know one,177
11,You're a cowboy like me,177
12,Never wanted love,177
13,Just a fancy car,177
14,Now I'm waiting by the phone,177
15,Like I'm sitting in an airport bar,177
16,You had some tricks up your sleeve,177
17,Takes one to know one,177
18,You're a cowboy like me,177
19,Perched in the dark,177
20,Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear,177
21,Like it could be love,177
22,I could be the way forward,177
23,Only if they pay for it,177
24,You're a bandit like me,177
25,Eyes full of stars,177
26,Hustling for the good life,177
27,Never thought I'd meet you here,177
28,It could be love,177
29,We could be the way forward,177
30,And I know I'll pay for it,177
31,You're a cowboy like me,177
32,Perched in the dark,177
33,Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear,177
34,Like it could be love,177
35,I could be the way forward,177
36,Only if they pay for it,177
37,You're a bandit like me,177
38,Eyes full of stars,177
39,Hustling for the good life,177
40,Never thought I'd meet you here,177
41,It could be love,177
42,We could be the way forward,177
43,And I know I'll pay for it,177
44,And the skeletons in both our closets,177
45,Plotted hard to fuck this up,177
46,And the old men that I've swindled,177
47,Really did believe I was the one,177
48,And the ladies lunching have their stories about,177
49,When you passed through town,177
50,But that was all before I locked it down,177
51,Now you hang from my lips,177
52,Like the Gardens of Babylon,177
53,With your boots beneath my bed,177
54,Forever is the sweetest con,177
55,I've had some tricks up my sleeve,177
56,Takes one to know one,177
57,You're a cowboy like me,177
58,And I'm never gonna love again,177
59,I'm never gonna love again,177
60,I'm never gonna love again,177
