1,I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night,167
2,Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife,167
3,And if it was an open/shut case,167
4,I never would've known from that look on your face,167
5,Lost in your current like a priceless wine,167
6,The more that you say,167
7,The less I know,167
8,Wherever you stray,167
9,I follow,167
10,I'm begging for you to take my hand,167
11,Wreck my plans,167
12,That's my man,167
13,Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,167
14,"Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in",167
15,As if you were a mythical thing,167
16,Like you were a trophy or a champion ring,167
17,And there was one prize I'd cheat to win,167
18,The more that you say,167
19,The less I know,167
20,Wherever you stray,167
21,I follow,167
22,I'm begging for you to take my hand,167
23,Wreck my plans,167
24,That's my man,167
25,You know that my train could take you home,167
26,Anywhere else is hollow,167
27,I'm begging for you to take my hand,167
28,Wreck my plans,167
29,That's my man,167
30,Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,167
31,They count me out time and time again,167
32,Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind,167
33,But I come back stronger than a '90s trend,167
34,Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark,167
35,Show me the places where the others gave you scars,167
36,Now this is an open/shut case,167
37,I guess I should've known from that look on your face,167
38,Every bait and switch was a work of art,167
39,The more that you say,167
40,The less I know,167
41,Wherever you stray,167
42,I follow,167
43,I'm begging for you to take my hand,167
44,Wreck my plans,167
45,That's my man,167
46,You know that my train could take you home,167
47,Anywhere else is hollow,167
48,I'm begging for you to take my hand,167
49,Wreck my plans,167
50,That's my man,167
51,The more that you say,167
52,The less I know,167
53,Whenever you stray,167
54,I follow,167
55,Begging for you to take my hand,167
56,Wreck my plans,167
57,That's my man,167
58,You know that my train could take you home,167
59,Anywhere else is hollow,167
60,Begging for you to take my hand,167
61,Wreck my plans,167
62,That's my man,167
63,"Hey, that's my man",167
64,"Yeah, that's my man",167
65,"Yeah, that's my man",167
66,Every bait and switch was a work of art,167
67,That's my man,167
68,"Hey, that's my man",167
69,I'm begging for you to take my hand,167
