1,Gray November,181
2,I've been down since July,181
3,Motion capture,181
4,Put me in a bad light,181
5,I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone,181
6,Trying to find the one where I went wrong,181
7,Writing letters,181
8,Addressed to the fire,181
9,And I was catching my breath,181
10,Staring out an open window,181
11,Catching my death,181
12,And I couldn't be sure,181
13,I had a feeling so peculiar,181
14,That this pain would be for,181
15,Evermore,181
16,Hey December,181
17,Guess I'm feeling unmoored,181
18,Can't remember,181
19,What I used to fight for,181
20,I rewind the tape but all it does is pause,181
21,On the very moment all was lost,181
22,Sending signals,181
23,To be double crossed,181
24,And I was catching my breath,181
25,Barefoot in the wildest winter,181
26,Catching my death,181
27,And I couldn't be sure,181
28,I had a feeling so peculiar,181
29,That this pain would be for,181
30,Evermore (Evermore),181
31,Can't not think of all the cost,181
32,And the things that will be lost,181
33,"Oh, can we just get a pause?",181
34,To be certain we'll be tall again,181
35,Whether weather be the frost,181
36,Or the violence of the dog days,181
37,"I'm on waves, out being tossed",181
38,Is there a line that I could just go cross?,181
39,And when I was shipwrecked,181
40,Can't think of all the cost now,181
41,I thought of you,181
42,All the things that will be lost now,181
43,In the cracks of light,181
44,Can we just get a pause?,181
45,I dreamed of you,181
46,To be certain we'll be tall again,181
47,If we think of all the costs,181
48,And it was real enough,181
49,Whether weather be the frost,181
50,To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days),181
51,Or the violence of the dog days,181
52,"Out on waves being tossed (Out on waves, I'm being tossed)",181
53,I swear,181
54,Is there a line that we can just go cross?,181
55,You were there,181
56,And I was catching my breath,181
57,Floors of a cabin creaking under my step,181
58,And I couldn't be sure,181
59,I had a feeling so peculiar,181
60,This pain wouldn't be for,181
61,Evermore,181
62,Evermore (Evermore),181
63,Evermore,181
64,This pain wouldn't be for evermore,181
65,Evermore,181
