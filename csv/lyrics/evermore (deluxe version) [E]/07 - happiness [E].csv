1,"Honey, when I'm above the trees",173
2,I see this for what it is,173
3,But now I'm right down in it,173
4,All the years I've given,173
5,Is just shit we're dividing up,173
6,Showed you all of my hiding spots,173
7,I was dancing when the music stopped,173
8,And in the disbelief,173
9,I can't face reinvention,173
10,I haven't met the new me yet,173
11,There'll be happiness after you,173
12,But there was happiness because of you,173
13,Both of these things can be true,173
14,There is happiness,173
15,Past the blood and bruise,173
16,Past the curses and cries,173
17,Beyond the terror in the nightfall,173
18,Haunted by the look in my eyes,173
19,That would've loved you for a lifetime,173
20,Leave it all behind,173
21,And there is happiness,173
22,"Tell me, when did your winning smile",173
23,Begin to look like a smirk?,173
24,When did all our lessons start to look like weapons pointed at my deepest hurt?,173
25,I hope she'll be a beautiful fool,173
26,Who takes my spot next to you,173
27,"No, I didn't mean that",173
28,"Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury",173
29,You haven't met the new me yet,173
30,There'll be happiness after me,173
31,But there was happiness because of me,173
32,Both of these things I believe,173
33,There is happiness,173
34,In our history,173
35,Across our great divide,173
36,There is a glorious sunrise,173
37,Dappled with the flickers of light,173
38,From the dress I wore at midnight,173
39,Leave it all behind,173
40,And there is happiness,173
41,I can't make it go away by making you a villain,173
42,I guess it's the price I pay for seven years in heaven,173
43,And I pulled your body into mine every goddamn night now I get fake niceties,173
44,No one teaches you what to do,173
45,When a good man hurts you,173
46,And you know you hurt him too,173
47,"Honey, when I'm above the trees",173
48,I see it for what it is,173
49,But now my eyes leak acid rain,173
50,On the pillow where you used to lay your head,173
51,After giving you the best I had,173
52,Tell me what to give after that,173
53,All you want from me now,173
54,Is the green light of forgiveness,173
55,You haven't met the new me yet,173
56,And I think she'll give you that,173
57,There'll be happiness after you,173
58,But there was happiness because of you too,173
59,Both of these things can be true,173
60,There is happiness,173
61,In our history,173
62,Across our great divide,173
63,There is a glorious sunrise,173
64,Dappled with the flickers of light,173
65,From the dress I wore at midnight,173
66,Leave it all behind,173
67,"Oh, leave it all behind",173
68,Leave it all behind,173
69,And there is happiness,173
