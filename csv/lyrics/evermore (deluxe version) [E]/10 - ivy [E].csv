1,How's one to know?,176
2,I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones,176
3,In a faith forgotten land,176
4,In from the snow,176
5,Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow,176
6,Tarnished but so grand,176
7,And the old widow goes to the stone every day,176
8,"But I don't, I just sit here and wait",176
9,Grieving for the living,176
10,"Oh, goddamn",176
11,My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand,176
12,"Taking mine, but it's been promised to another",176
13,"Oh, I can't",176
14,Stop you putting roots in my dreamland,176
15,"My house of stone, your ivy grows",176
16,And now I'm covered in you,176
17,I wish to know,176
18,The fatal flaw that makes you long to be,176
19,Magnificently cursed,176
20,He's in the room,176
21,Your opal eyes are all I wish to see,176
22,He wants what's only yours,176
23,"Oh, goddamn",176
24,My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand,176
25,"Taking mine, but it's been promised to another",176
26,"Oh, I can't",176
27,Stop you putting roots in my dreamland,176
28,"My house of stone, your ivy grows",176
29,And now I'm covered,176
30,Clover blooms in the fields,176
31,"Spring breaks loose, the time is near",176
32,What would he do if he found us out?,176
33,"Crescent moon, coast is clear",176
34,"Spring breaks loose, but so does fear",176
35,He's gonna burn this house to the ground,176
36,How's one to know?,176
37,I'd live and die for moments that we stole,176
38,On begged and borrowed time,176
39,So tell me to run,176
40,Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become,176
41,And drink my husband's wine,176
42,"Oh, goddamn",176
43,My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand,176
44,"Taking mine, but it's been promised to another",176
45,"Oh, I can't",176
46,Stop you putting roots in my dreamland,176
47,"My house of stone, your ivy grows",176
48,And now I'm covered in you,176
49,And I'm covered in you,176
50,"So yeah, it's a fire",176
51,It's a goddamn blaze in the dark,176
52,And you started it,176
53,You started it,176
54,"So yeah, it's a war",176
55,It's the goddamn fight of my life,176
56,And you started it,176
57,You started it,176
58,"Oh, I can't",176
59,Stop you putting roots in my dreamland,176
60,"My house of stone, your ivy grows",176
61,And now I'm covered,176
62,In you,176
63,In you,176
64,Now I'm covered in you,176
65,In you,176
