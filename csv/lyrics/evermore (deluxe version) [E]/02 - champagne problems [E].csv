1,You booked the night train for a reason,168
2,So you could sit there in this hurt,168
3,Bustling crowds or silent sleepers,168
4,You're not sure which is worse,168
5,Because I dropped your hand while dancing,168
6,Left you out there standing,168
7,Crestfallen on the landing,168
8,Champagne problems,168
9,Your mom's ring in your pocket,168
10,My picture in your wallet,168
11,"Your heart was glass, I dropped it",168
12,Champagne problems,168
13,You told your family for a reason,168
14,You couldn't keep it in,168
15,Your sister splashed out on the bottle,168
16,Now no one's celebrating,168
17,"Dom Perignon, you brought it",168
18,No crowd of friends applauded,168
19,Your hometown skeptics called it,168
20,Champagne problems,168
21,"You had a speech, you're speechless",168
22,Love slipped beyond your reaches,168
23,And I couldn't give a reason,168
24,Champagne problems,168
25,Your Midas touch on the Chevy door,168
26,November flush and your flannel cure,168
27,"""This dorm was once a madhouse""",168
28,"I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me"" how",168
29,"Evergreen, our group of friends",168
30,Don't think we'll say that word again,168
31,And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls,168
32,That we once walked through,168
33,"One for the money, two for the show",168
34,I never was ready,168
35,So I watch you go,168
36,Sometimes you just don't know the answer,168
37,Till someone's on their knees and asks you,168
38,"""She would've made such a lovely bride",168
39,"What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said",168
40,But you'll find the real thing instead,168
41,She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred,168
42,And hold your hand while dancing,168
43,Never leave you standing,168
44,Crestfallen on the landing,168
45,With champagne problems,168
46,Your mom's ring in your pocket,168
47,Her picture in your wallet,168
48,And you won't remember all my,168
49,Champagne problems,168
50,You won't remember all my,168
51,Champagne problems,168
