1,Fatefully,178
2,I tried to pick my battles,178
3,Til the battle picked me,178
4,Misery,178
5,Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep,178
6,And you passed right by,178
7,I was in the alley surrounded on all sides,178
8,The knife cuts both ways,178
9,"If the shoe fits, walk in it",178
10,Til your high heels break,178
11,And I fell from the pedestal,178
12,Right down the rabbit hole,178
13,"Long story short, it was a bad time",178
14,Pushed from the precipice,178
15,Clung to the nearest lips,178
16,"Long story short, it was the wrong guy",178
17,Now I'm all about you,178
18,I'm all about you,178
19,I'm all about you,178
20,Actually,178
21,I always felt I must look better in the rear view,178
22,Missing me,178
23,At the golden gates they once held the keys to,178
24,When I dropped my sword,178
25,I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door,178
26,And we live in peace,178
27,But if someone comes at us,178
28,This time I'm ready,178
29,'Cause I fell from the pedestal,178
30,Right down the rabbit hole,178
31,"Long story short, it was a bad time",178
32,Pushed from the precipice,178
33,Clung to the nearest lips,178
34,"Long story short, it was the wrong guy",178
35,Now I'm all about you,178
36,I'm all about you,178
37,I'm all about you,178
38,No more keeping score,178
39,Now I just keep you warm,178
40,No more tug of war,178
41,Now I just know there's more,178
42,No more keeping score,178
43,Now I just keep you warm,178
44,And my waves meet your shore,178
45,Ever and evermore,178
46,Past me,178
47,I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things,178
48,Your nemeses will defeat themselves,178
49,Before you get the chance to swing,178
50,And he's passing by,178
51,Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky,178
52,And he feels like home,178
53,"If the shoe fits, walk in it",178
54,Everywhere you go,178
55,And I fell from the pedestal,178
56,Right down the rabbit hole,178
57,"Long story short, it was a bad time",178
58,Pushed from the precipice,178
59,Climbed right back up the cliff,178
60,"Long story short, I survived",178
61,Now I'm all about you,178
62,I'm all about you,178
63,I'm all about you,178
64,I'm all about you,178
65,I'm all about you,178
66,I'm all about you,178
67,"Long story short, it was a bad time",178
68,"Long story short, I survived",178
