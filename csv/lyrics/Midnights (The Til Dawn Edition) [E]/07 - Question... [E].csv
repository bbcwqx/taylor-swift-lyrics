2,"Good girl, sad boy",190
3,"Big city, wrong choices",190
4,We had one thing going on,190
5,I swear that it was something,190
6,'Cause I don't remember who I was before you,190
7,Painted all my nights,190

10,"Fuckin' situations, circumstances",190
11,Miscommunications and I,190
12,Have to say,190
13,By the way,190
14,I just may like some explanations,190
15,Can I ask you a question?,190
16,Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room?,190
17,And every single one of your friends was making fun of you,190
18,But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too?,190

28,With some dickhead guy,190
29,That you saw that night,190
30,But you were on something,190
31,It was one drink after another,190
32,Fuckin' politics and gender roles,190
33,And you're not sure and I don't know,190
34,Got swept away in the gray,190
35,I just may like to have a conversation,190
36,Can I ask you a question?,190
37,Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room?,190
38,And every single one of your friends was making fun of you,190

41,Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh,190
42,Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight? Oh,190
43,When she said it was too much?,190
44,Do you wish you could still touch her?,190
45,It's just a question,190
46,Does it feel like everything's just like second best after that meteor strike?,190
47,"And what's that that I heard, that you're still with her?",190
48,"That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable",190
49,And right,190
50,But tonight,190
51,Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?),190

55,Then what did you do?,190
56,Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh,190
57,Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight? Oh,190
58,When she said it was too much?,190
59,Do you wish you could still touch her?,190
60,It's just a question,190
