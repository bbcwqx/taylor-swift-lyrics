1,"If you would've blinked, then I would've",202
2,Looked away at the first glance,202
3,If you tasted poison you could've,202
4,Spit me out at the first chance,202
5,"If I was some paint, did it splatter",202
6,On a promising grown man?,202
7,"And if I was a child, did it matter",202
8,If you got to wash your hands?,202
9,"Ooh, all I used to do was pray",202
10,"Would've, could've, should've",202
11,If you'd never looked my way,202
12,I would've stayed on my knees,202
13,And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil,202
14,"At nineteen, and the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven",202
15,"And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts",202
16,Memories feel like weapons,202
17,And now that I know,202
18,I wish you'd left me wondering,202
19,If you never touched me I would've,202
20,Gone along with the righteous,202
21,If I never blushed then they could've,202
22,Never whispered about this,202
23,And if you never saved me from boredom,202
24,I could've gone on as I was,202
25,"But, Lord, you made me feel important",202
26,And then you tried to erase us,202
27,"Ooh, you're a crisis of my faith",202
28,"Would've, could've, should've",202
29,If I'd only played it safe,202
30,I would've stayed on my knees,202
31,And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil,202
32,"At nineteen, and the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven",202
33,"And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts",202
34,Memories feel like weapons,202
35,And now that I know,202
36,I wish you'd left me wondering,202
37,God rest my soul,202
38,I miss who I used to be,202
39,The tomb won't close,202
40,Stained glass windows in my mind,202
41,I regret you all the time,202
42,I can't let this go,202
43,I fight with you in my sleep,202
44,The wound won't close,202
45,I keep on waiting for a sign,202
46,I regret you all the time,202
47,"If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?",202
48,"Years of tearing down our banners, you and I",202
49,Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts,202
50,"Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first",202
51,And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil,202
52,"At nineteen, and the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven",202
53,"And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts",202
54,Memories feel like weapons,202
55,And now that I know,202
56,I wish you'd left me wondering,202
57,God rest my soul,202
58,I miss who I used to be,202
59,The tomb won't close,202
60,Stained glass windows in my mind,202
61,I regret you all the time,202
62,I can't let this go,202
63,I fight with you in my sleep,202
64,The wound won't close,202
65,I keep on waiting for a sign,202
66,I regret you all the time,202
67,"Oh, God rest my soul",202
68,I miss who I used to be,202
69,The tomb won't close,202
70,Stained glass windows in my mind,202
71,I regret you all the time,202
72,I can't let this go,202
73,I fight with you in my sleep,202
74,The wound won't close,202
75,I keep on waiting for a sign,202
76,I regret you all the time,202
