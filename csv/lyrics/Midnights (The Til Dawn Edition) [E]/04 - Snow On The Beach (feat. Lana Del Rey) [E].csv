1,One night a few moons ago,187
2,I saw flecks of what could've been lights,187
3,But it might just have been you,187
4,Passing by unbeknownst to me,187
5,Life is emotionally abusive,187
6,And time can't stop me quite like you did,187
7,"And my flight was awful, thanks for asking",187
8,"I'm unglued, thanks to you",187
9,And it's like snow at the beach,187
10,"Weird, but fuckin' beautiful",187
11,Flying in a dream,187
12,Stars by the pocketful,187
13,"You wanting me tonight, feels impossible",187
14,"But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around",187
15,Like snow on the beach,187
16,Like snow on the beach,187
17,Like snow on the beach,187
18,"Like snow, oh",187
19,This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen,187
20,I searched 'aurora borealis green',187
21,I've never seen someone lit from within,187
22,Blurring out my periphery,187
23,My smile is like I won a contest,187
24,And to hide that would be so dishonest,187
25,And it's fine to fake it till you make it,187
26,Till you do,187
27,Till it's true,187
28,Now it's like snow at the beach,187
29,"Weird, but fuckin' beautiful",187
30,Flying in a dream,187
31,Stars by the pocketful,187
32,"You wanting me tonight, feels impossible",187
33,"But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around",187
34,Like snow on the beach,187
35,Like snow on the beach,187
36,Like snow on the beach,187
37,"Like snow, oh",187
38,"I can't speak, afraid to jinx it (I, can't)",187
39,"I don't even dare to wish it (I, don't)",187
40,But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet,187
41,Now I'm All For You like Janet,187
42,"Can this be a real thing, can it?",187
43,Are we falling like,187
44,Snow at the beach,187
45,"Weird, but fuckin' beautiful",187
46,Flying in a dream,187
47,Stars by the pocketful,187
48,"You wanting me tonight, feels impossible",187
49,"But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around",187
50,Like snow on the beach,187
51,Like snow on the beach,187
52,Like snow on the beach,187
53,Like snow,187
54,"But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around",187
55,Like snow on the beach,187
56,"It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down",187
57,Like snow on the beach,187
58,"It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down",187
59,"It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down",187
60,"Coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down",187
