1,"When the morning came, we",185
2,Were cleaning incense off your,185
3,Vinyl shelf 'cause we lost track of time again,185
4,Laughing with my feet in your lap,185
5,Like you were my closest friend,185
6,"""How'd we end up on the floor anyway?""",185
7,"You say, ""Your roommate's cheap-ass screw top Rosé, that's how""",185
8,I see you every day now,185
9,And I chose you,185
10,The one I was dancing with,185
11,"In New York, no shoes",185
12,Looked up at the sky and it was,185
13,The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me,185
14,And how the blood rushed into my cheeks,185
15,"So scarlet, it was",185
16,The mark they saw on my collarbone,185
17,The rust that grew between telephones,185
18,The lips I used to call home,185
19,"So scarlet, it was maroon",185
20,"When the silence came, we",185
21,Were shaking blind and hazy,185
22,How the hell did we lose sight of us again?,185
23,Sobbing with your head in your hands,185
24,Ain't that the way shit always ends?,185
25,You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway,185
26,"Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us",185
27,"I feel you, no matter what",185
28,The rubies that I gave up,185
29,And I lost you,185
30,The one I was dancing with,185
31,"In New York, no shoes",185
32,Looked up at the sky and it was maroon,185
33,The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me,185
34,And how the blood rushed into my cheeks,185
35,"So scarlet, it was maroon",185
36,The mark they saw on my collarbone,185
37,The rust that grew between telephones,185
38,The lips I used to call home,185
39,"So scarlet, it was maroon",185
40,And I wake with your memory over me,185
41,"That's a real fuckin' legacy, legacy (It was maroon)",185
42,And I wake with your memory over me,185
43,That's a real fuckin' legacy to leave,185
44,The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me,185
45,And how the blood rushed into my cheeks,185
46,"So scarlet, it was maroon",185
47,The mark they saw on my collarbone,185
48,The rust that grew between telephones,185
49,The lips I used to call home,185
50,"So scarlet, it was maroon",185
51,It was maroon,185
52,It was maroon,185
