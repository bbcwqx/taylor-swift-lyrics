1,One night a few moons ago I,205
2,Saw flecks of what could’ve been lights,205
3,But it might just have been you,205
4,Passing by unbeknownst to me,205
5,Life is emotionally abusive,205
6,And time can’t stop me quite like you did,205
7,"And my flight was awful, thanks for asking",205
8,"I'm unglued, thanks to you",205
9,And it’s like snow at the beach,205
10,"Weird, but fuckin' beautiful",205
11,Flying in a dream,205
12,Stars by the pocketful,205
13,"You wanting me tonight, feels impossible",205
14,"But it’s comin’ down, no sound, it’s all around",205
15,Like snow on the beach,205
16,Like snow on the beach,205
17,Like snow on the beach,205
18,"Like snow, ah",205
19,This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen,205
20,I searched ‘aurora borealis green’,205
21,I've never seen someone lit from within,205
22,Blurring out my periphery,205
23,My smile is like I won a contest,205
24,And to hide that would be so dishonest,205
25,And it's fine to fake it till you make it,205
26,Till you do,205
27,Till it's true,205
28,Now it's like snow at the beach,205
29,"Weird, but fuckin' beautiful",205
30,Flying in a dream,205
31,Stars by the pocketful,205
32,"You wanting me tonight, feels impossible",205
33,"But it’s comin’ down, no sound, it’s all around",205
34,Like snow on the beach,205
35,Like snow on the beach,205
36,Like snow on the beach,205
37,"Like snow, ah",205
38,"I can’t speak, afraid to jinx it",205
39,"I, can't",205
40,I don’t even dare to wish it,205
41,"I, don't",205
42,But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet,205
43,Now I’m all for you like Janet,205
44,"Can this be a real thing, can it?",205
45,Are we falling like snow at the beach,205
46,"Weird, but fuckin' beautiful",205
47,Flying in a dream,205
48,Stars by the pocketful,205
49,"You wanting me tonight, feels impossible",205
50,"But it’s comin’ down, no sound, it’s all around",205
51,Like snow on the beach,205
52,Like snow on the beach,205
53,Like snow on the beach,205
54,"Like snow, ah",205
55,"It's coming down, no sound, it's all around",205
56,Like snow on the beach,205
57,"Like snow, like snow, ah yeah",205
