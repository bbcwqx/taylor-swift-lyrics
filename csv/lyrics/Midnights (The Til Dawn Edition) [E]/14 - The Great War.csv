1,My knuckles were bruised like violets,197
2,Sucker punching walls,197
3,Cursed you as I sleep talked,197
4,Spineless in my tomb of silence,197
5,Tore your banners down,197
6,Took the battle underground,197
7,And maybe it was egos swinging,197
8,Maybe it was her,197
9,Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur,197
10,"All that bloodshed, crimson clover",197
11,"Uh-huh, sweet dream was over",197
12,My hand was the one you reached for,197
13,All throughout the Great War,197
14,Always remember,197
15,"Uh-huh, tears on the letter",197
16,I vowed not to cry anymore,197
17,If we survived the Great War,197
18,You drew up some good faith treaties,197
19,I drew curtains closed,197
20,Drank my poison all alone,197
21,You said I have to trust more freely,197
22,But diesel is desire,197
23,You were playing with fire,197
24,And maybe it's the past that's talking,197
25,Screaming from the crypt,197
26,Telling me to punish you for things you never did,197
27,So I justified it,197
28,"All that bloodshed, crimson clover",197
29,"Uh-huh, the bombs were closer",197
30,My hand was the one you reached for,197
31,All throughout the Great War,197
32,Always remember,197
33,"Uh-huh, the burning embers",197
34,I vowed not to fight anymore,197
35,If we survived the Great War,197
36,"Uh-huh, uh-huh",197
37,It turned into something bigger,197
38,Somewhere in the haze,197
39,Got a sense I'd been betrayed,197
40,Your finger on my hairpin triggers,197
41,Soldier down on that icy ground,197
42,Looked up at me with honor and truth,197
43,Broken and blue,197
44,So I called off the troops,197
45,That was the night I nearly lost you,197
46,I really thought I'd lost you,197
47,We can plant a memory garden,197
48,Say a solemn prayer,197
49,Place a poppy in my hair,197
50,There's no morning glory,197
51,"It was war, it wasn't fair",197
52,And we will never go back,197
53,"To that bloodshed, crimson clover",197
54,"Uh-huh, the worst was over",197
55,My hand was the one you reached for,197
56,All throughout the Great War,197
57,Always remember,197
58,"Uh-huh, we're burned for better",197
59,"I vowed, I would always be yours",197
60,'Cause we survived the Great War,197
61,"Uh-huh, uh-huh",197
62,I will always be yours,197
63,'Cause we survived the Great War,197
64,Uh-huh,197
65,"I vowed, I will always be yours",197
