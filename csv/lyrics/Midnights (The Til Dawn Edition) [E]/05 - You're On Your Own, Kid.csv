1,Summer went away,188
2,Still the yearning stays,188
3,I play it cool with the best of them,188
4,I wait patiently,188
5,He's gonna notice me,188
6,"It's okay, we're the best of friends",188
7,Anyway,188
8,I hear it in your voice,188
9,You're smoking with your boys,188
10,I touch my phone as if it's your face,188
11,I didn't choose this town,188
12,I dream of getting out,188
13,There's just one who could make me stay,188
14,All my days,188
15,From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes,188
16,I waited ages to see you there,188
17,I search the party of better bodies,188
18,Just to learn that you never cared,188
19,"You're on your own, kid",188
20,You always have been,188
21,I see the great escape,188
22,"So long, Daisy May",188
23,"I picked the petals, he loves me not",188
24,Something different bloomed,188
25,Writing in my room,188
26,I play my songs in the parking lot,188
27,I'll run away,188
28,From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes,188
29,I called a taxi to take me there,188
30,I search the party of better bodies,188
31,Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare,188
32,"You're on your own, kid",188
33,You always have been,188
34,From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes,188
35,"I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this",188
36,I hosted parties and starved my body,188
37,Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss,188
38,"The jokes weren't funny, I took the money",188
39,My friends from home don't know what to say,188
40,I looked around in a blood-soaked gown,188
41,And I saw something they can't take away,188
42,"'Cause there were pages turned, with the bridges burned",188
43,Everything you lose is a step you take,188
44,"So make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it",188
45,You've got no reason to be afraid,188
46,"You're on your own, kid",188
47,"Yeah, you can face this",188
48,"You're on your own, kid",188
49,You always have been,188
