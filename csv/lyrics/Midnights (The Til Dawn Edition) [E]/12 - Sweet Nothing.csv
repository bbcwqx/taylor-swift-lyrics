1,I spy with my little tired eye,195
2,Tiny as a firefly,195
3,A pebble that we picked up last July,195
4,Down deep inside your pocket,195
5,We almost forgot it,195
6,Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?,195
7,Ooh,195
8,Ooh,195
9,They said the end is coming,195
10,Everyone's up to something,195
11,I find myself running home to your sweet nothings,195
12,"Outside, they're push and shoving",195
13,You're in the kitchen humming,195
14,All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing,195
15,On the way home,195
16,I wrote a poem,195
17,"You say, ""What a mind""",195
18,This happens all the time,195
19,Ooh,195
20,Ooh,195
21,'Cause they said the end is coming,195
22,Everyone's up to something,195
23,I find myself running home to your sweet nothings,195
24,"Outside, they're push and shoving",195
25,You're in the kitchen humming,195
26,All that you ever wanted from me was nothing,195
27,Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors,195
28,And smooth-talking hucksters,195
29,Out glad-handing each other,195
30,And the voices that implore,195
31,"""You should be doing more""",195
32,"To you, I can admit",195
33,That I'm just too soft for all of it,195
34,Ooh,195
35,They said the end is coming,195
36,Everyone's up to something,195
37,I find myself running home to your sweet nothings,195
38,"Outside, they're push and shoving",195
39,You're in the kitchen humming,195
40,All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing,195
41,They said the end is coming (They said the end is coming),195
42,Everyone's up to something (Everyone's up to something),195
43,I find myself running home to your sweet nothings,195
44,"Outside, they're push and shoving (Outside, they're push and shoving)",195
45,You're in the kitchen humming (You're in the kitchen humming),195
46,All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing,195
