1,"Once upon a time, the planets and the fates and all the stars aligned",196
2,You and I ended up in the same room at the same time,196
3,And the touch of a hand lit the fuse,196
4,Of a chain reaction of countermoves,196
5,To assess the equation of you,196
6,"Checkmate, I couldn't lose",196
7,What if I told you none of it was accidental?,196
8,"And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me",196
9,I laid the groundwork and then just like clockwork,196
10,The dominoes cascaded in a line,196
11,What if I told you I'm a mastermind?,196
12,And now you're mine,196
13,It was all by design,196
14,'Cause I'm a mastermind,196
15,You see all the wisest women had to do it this way,196
16,'Cause we were born to be the pawn in every lover's game,196
17,"If you fail to plan, you plan to fail",196
18,Strategy sets the scene for the tale,196
19,I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails,196
20,And the liquor in our cocktails,196
21,What if I told you none of it was accidental?,196
22,"And the first night that you saw me, I knew I wanted your body",196
23,I laid the groundwork and then just like clockwork,196
24,The dominoes cascaded in a line,196
25,What if I told you I'm a mastermind?,196
26,And now you're mine,196
27,It was all my design,196
28,'Cause I'm a mastermind,196
29,No one wanted to play with me as a little kid,196
30,So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since,196
31,To make them love me and make it seem effortless,196
32,This is the first time I've felt the need to confess,196
33,And I swear,196
34,I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian 'cause I care,196
35,So I told you none of it was accidental,196
36,"And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me",196
37,I laid the groundwork and then saw a wide smirk,196
38,"On your face, you knew the entire time",196
39,You knew that I'm a mastermind,196
40,And now you're mine,196
41,"Yeah, all you did was smile",196
42,'Cause I'm a mastermind,196
