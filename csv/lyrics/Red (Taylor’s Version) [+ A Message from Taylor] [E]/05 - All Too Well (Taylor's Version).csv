1,I walked through the door with you,68
2,The air was cold,68
3,But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I,68
4,Left my scarf there at your sister's house,68
5,And you've still got it in your drawer even now,68
6,"Oh, your sweet disposition",68
7,And my wide-eyed gaze,68
8,"We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate",68
9,Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,68
10,And I can picture it after all these days,68
11,And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more,68
12,"And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all, oh-oh-oh",68
13,'Cause there we are again on that,68
14,Little town street,68
15,You almost ran the red 'cause you were,68
16,Looking over at me,68
17,"Wind in my hair, I was there",68
18,I remember it all too well,68
19,Photo album on the counter,68
20,Your cheeks were turning red,68
21,You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed,68
22,And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team,68
23,"You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me",68
24,And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do,68
25,And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to,68
26,'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night,68
27,We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light,68
28,"Down the stairs, I was there",68
29,"I remember it all too well, yeah",68
30,And maybe we got lost in translation,68
31,Maybe I asked for too much,68
32,But maybe this thing was a masterpiece,68
33,Till you tore it all up,68
34,"Running scared, I was there",68
35,I remember it all too well,68
36,And you call me up again,68
37,Just to break me like a promise,68
38,So casually cruel in the name of being honest,68
39,I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here,68
40,"'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well",68
41,"Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it",68
42,I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it,68
43,After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own,68
44,Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone,68
45,But you keep my old scarf from that very first week,68
46,'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me,68
47,You can't get rid of it,68
48,'Cause you remember it all too well,68
49,'Cause there we are again when I loved you so,68
50,Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known,68
51,"It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well",68
52,"Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all",68
53,"Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all",68
54,"It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well",68
