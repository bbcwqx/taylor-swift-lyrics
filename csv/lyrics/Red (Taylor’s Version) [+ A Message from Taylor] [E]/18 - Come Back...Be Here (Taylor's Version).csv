1,You said it in a simple way,81
2,"4 a.m., the second day",81
3,How strange that I don't know you at all,81
4,Stumbled through the long goodbye,81
5,"One last kiss, then catch your flight",81
6,Right when I was just about to fall,81
7,I told myself don't get attached,81
8,But in my mind I play it back,81
9,Spinning faster than the plane that took you,81
10,And this is when the feeling sinks in,81
11,I don't wanna miss you like this,81
12,"Come back, be here",81
13,"Come back, be here",81
14,I guess you're in New York today,81
15,I don't wanna need you this way,81
16,"Come back, be here",81
17,"Come back, be here",81
18,The delicate beginning rush,81
19,The feeling you can know so much,81
20,Without knowing anything at all,81
21,And now that I can put this down,81
22,If I had known what I know now,81
23,I never would've played so nonchalant,81
24,Taxi cabs and busy streets,81
25,That never bring you back to me,81
26,I can't help but wish you took me with you,81
27,And this is when the feeling sinks in,81
28,I don't wanna miss you like this,81
29,"Come back, be here",81
30,"Come back, be here",81
31,I guess you're in London today,81
32,And I don't wanna need you this way,81
33,"Come back, be here",81
34,"Come back, be here",81
35,This is falling in love in the cruelest way,81
36,This is falling for you when you are worlds away,81
37,"In New York, be here",81
38,"But you're in London, and I break down",81
39,'Cause it's not fair that you're not around,81
40,This is when the feeling sinks in,81
41,I don't wanna miss you like this,81
42,"Come back, be here",81
43,"Come back, be here",81
44,I guess you're in New York today,81
45,And I don't wanna need you this way,81
46,"Come back, be here",81
47,"Come back, be here",81
48,I don't wanna miss you like this,81
49,"Come back, be here",81
50,"Come back, be here",81
