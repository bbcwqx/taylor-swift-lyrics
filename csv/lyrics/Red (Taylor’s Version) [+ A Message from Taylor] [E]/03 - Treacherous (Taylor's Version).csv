1,Put your lips close to mine,66
2,As long as they don't touch,66
3,"Out of focus, eye to eye",66
4,Till the gravity's too much,66
5,And I'll do anything you say,66
6,If you say it with your hands,66
7,And I'd be smart to walk away,66
8,But you're quicksand,66
9,This slope is treacherous,66
10,This path is reckless,66
11,This slope is treacherous,66
12,"And I, I, I like it",66
13,I can't decide if it's a choice,66
14,Getting swept away,66
15,I hear the sound of my own voice,66
16,Asking you to stay,66
17,All we are is skin and bone,66
18,Trained to get along,66
19,Forever going with the flow,66
20,But you're friction,66
21,This slope is treacherous,66
22,This path is reckless,66
23,This slope is treacherous,66
24,"I, I, I like it",66
25,Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will,66
26,"Get you a, get you alone",66
27,Your name has echoed through my mind and I just,66
28,"Think you should, think you should know",66
29,That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would,66
30,"Follow you, follow you home",66
31,"I'll follow you, follow you home",66
32,This hope is treacherous,66
33,This daydream is dangerous,66
34,This hope is treacherous,66
35,"I, I, I",66
36,"I, I, I",66
37,"I, I, I",66
38,Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will,66
39,"Get you a, get you alone",66
40,Your name has echoed through my mind and I just,66
41,"Think you should, think you should know",66
42,That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will,66
43,"Follow you, follow you home",66
44,"I'll follow you, follow you home",66
45,"I'll follow you, follow you home",66
46,"I'll follow you, follow you home",66
47,This slope is treacherous,66
48,"I, I, I like it",66
