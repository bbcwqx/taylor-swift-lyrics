1,I know that you like me,88
2,And it's kinda frightening,88
3,"Standing here waiting, waiting",88
4,And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes,88
5,Tongue tied,88
6,"But, now, you're so far away and I'm down",88
7,Feeling like a face in the crowd,88
8,"I'm reaching for you, terrified",88
9,'Cause you could be the one that I love,88
10,I could be the one that you dream of,88
11,A message in a bottle is all I can do,88
12,Standing here hoping it gets to you,88
13,You could be the one that I keep,88
14,And I could be the reason you can't sleep at night,88
15,A message in a bottle is all I can do,88
16,Standing here hoping it gets to you,88
17,These days I'm restless,88
18,Workdays are endless,88
19,"Look how you made me, made me",88
20,But time moves faster,88
21,Replaying your laughter,88
22,Disaster,88

24,Feeling like a face in the crowd,88
25,"I'm reaching for you, terrified",88
