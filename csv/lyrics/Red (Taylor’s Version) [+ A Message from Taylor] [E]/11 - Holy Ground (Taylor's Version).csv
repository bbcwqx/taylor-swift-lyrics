1,I was reminiscing just the other day,74
2,"While having coffee all alone, and lord it took me away",74
3,Back to a first glance feeling on New York time,74
4,Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme,74
5,"Took off faster than a green light, go",74
6,"Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know",74
7,I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made,74
8,And that was the first day,74
9,"And darling, it was good",74
10,Never looking down,74
11,And right there where we stood,74
12,Was holy ground,74
13,Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress,74
14,We had this big wide city all to ourselves,74
15,"We block the noise with the sound of ""I need you""",74
16,And for the first time I had something to lose,74
17,And I guess we fell apart in the usual way,74
18,And the story's got dust on every page,74
19,But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now,74
20,And I see your face in every crowd,74
21,"'Cause darling, it was good",74
22,Never looking down,74
23,And right there where we stood,74
24,Was holy ground,74
25,"Tonight, I'm gonna dance",74
26,For all that we've been through,74
27,But I don't wanna dance,74
28,If I'm not dancing with you,74
29,"Tonight, I'm gonna dance",74
30,Like you were in this room,74
31,But I don't want to dance,74
32,If I'm not dancing with you,74
33,It was good,74
34,Never looking down,74
35,And right there where we stood,74
36,Was holy ground,74
37,"Tonight, I'm gonna dance",74
38,For all that we've been through,74
39,But I don't want to dance,74
40,If I'm not dancing with you,74
41,"Tonight, I'm gonna dance",74
42,Like you were in this room,74
43,But I don't want to dance,74
44,If I'm not dancing with you,74
