1,All I knew this morning when I woke,77
2,"Is I know something now, know something now",77
3,I didn't before,77
4,And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago,77
5,Is green eyes and freckles and your smile,77
6,In the back of my mind making me feel like,77

12,And your eyes look like coming home,77

14,Everything has changed,77
15,All I know is you held the door,77
16,You'll be mine and I'll be yours,77
17,All I know since yesterday,77
18,Is everything has changed,77
19,"And all my walls stood tall, painted blue",77
20,"But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down",77
21,And open up the door for you,77
22,And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies,77

39,And meet me there tonight,77
