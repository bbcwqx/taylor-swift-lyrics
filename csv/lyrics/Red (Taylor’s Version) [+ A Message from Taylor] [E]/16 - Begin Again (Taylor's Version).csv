2,"He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do",79

6,"But you got here early and you stand and wave, I walk to you",79
7,You pull my chair out and help me in,79
8,"And you don't know how nice that is, but I do",79
9,And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid,79
10,I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did,79
11,I've been spending the last eight months,79

35,"But on a Wednesday, in a café",79
36,I watched it begin again,79
