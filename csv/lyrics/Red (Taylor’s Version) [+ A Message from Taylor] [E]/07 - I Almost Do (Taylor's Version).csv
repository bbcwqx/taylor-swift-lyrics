1,I bet this time of night you're still up,70
2,I bet you're tired from a long hard week,70
3,I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window,70
4,Looking out at the city and I bet,70
5,Sometimes you wonder 'bout me,70
6,And I just want to tell you,70
7,It takes everything in me,70
8,Not to call you,70
9,And I wish I could run to you,70
10,And I hope you know that,70
11,Every time I don't,70
12,I almost do,70
13,I almost do,70
14,I bet you think I either moved on or hate you,70
15,"'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply",70
16,"I bet it never, ever occurred to you",70
17,That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye,70
18,And I just want to tell you,70
19,It takes everything in me,70
20,Not to call you,70
21,And I wish I could run to you,70
22,And I hope you know that,70
23,Every time I don't,70
24,"I almost do, I almost do",70
25,"Oh, we made quite a mess, babe",70
26,It's probably better off this way,70
27,"And I confess, baby",70
28,In my dreams you're touching my face,70
29,And asking me if I'd want to try again with you,70
30,And I almost do,70
31,And I just want to tell you,70
32,It takes everything in me,70
33,Not to call you,70
34,And I wish I could run to you,70
35,And I hope you know that,70
36,Every time I don't,70
37,"I almost do, I almost do",70
38,I bet this time of night you're still up,70
39,I bet you're tired from a long hard week,70
40,I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window,70
41,Looking out at the city and I hope,70
42,Sometimes you wonder 'bout me,70
