1,Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames,218

3,We embroidered the memories of the time I was away,218
4,"Stitching, ""We were just kids, babe""",218
5,"I said, ""I don't mind, it takes time""",218
6,I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed,218
7,I felt aglow like this,218
8,Never before and never since,218
9,"If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary",218
10,You and I go from one kiss to getting married,218
11,"Still alive, killing time at the cemetery",218

13,"In your suit and tie, in the nick of time",218
14,"You lowdown boy, you standup guy, you",218
15,"Holy Ghost, you told me I'm",218
16,The love of your life,218
17,You said I'm the love of your life,218
18,About a million times,218
19,"Who's gonna tell me the truth, when you blew in with the winds of fate",218

25,But I felt a hole like this,218
26,Never before and ever since,218
27,"If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary",218
28,What we thought was for all time was momentary,218
29,"Still alive, killing time at the cemetery",218
30,Never quite buried,218
31,You cinephile in black and white,218

34,You said I'm the love of your life,218
35,"You shit-talked me under the table, talking rings and talking cradles",218
36,I wish I could un-recall how we almost had it all,218
37,"Dancing phantoms on the terrace, are they second-hand embarrassed",218
38,That I can't get out of bed 'cause something counterfeit's dead?,218
39,It was legendary,218

42,"Oh, what a valiant roar",218
43,What a bland goodbye,218
44,The coward claimed he was a lion,218
45,I'm combing through the braids of lies,218
46,"""I'll never leave""",218
47,"""Never mind""",218
48,"Our field of dreams, engulfed in fire",218
49,"Your arson's match, your somber eyes",218
50,And I'll still see it until I die,218
51,You're the loss of my life,218
