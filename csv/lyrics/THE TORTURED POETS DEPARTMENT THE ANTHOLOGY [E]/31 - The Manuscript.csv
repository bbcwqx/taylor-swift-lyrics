1,Now and then she re-reads the manuscript,237
2,Of the entire torrid affair,237
3,They compared their licenses,237
4,"He said, ""I'm not a donor but",237
5,"I'd give you my heart if you needed it""",237
6,"She rolled her eyes and said, ""You're a professional""",237
7,"He said, ""No, just a Good Samaritan""",237
8,He said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was,237
9,Soon they’d be pushing strollers,237
10,But soon it was over,237
11,In the age of him she wished she was thirty,237
12,And made coffee every morning in a French press,237
13,Afterward she only ate kids' cereal,237
14,And couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed,237

18,Since she was so wise beyond her years,237

21,And the years passed like scenes of a show,237
22,The professor said to write what you know,237
23,Looking backwards might be the only way,237

25,Then the actors were hitting their marks,237
26,And the slow dance was alight with the sparks,237
27,And the tears fell in synchronicity with the score,237
28,And at last,237
29,She knew what the agony had been for,237
30,The only thing that's left is the manuscript,237
31,One last souvenir from my trip to your shores,237
32,Now and then I re-read the manuscript,237
33,But the story isn't mine anymore,237
