1,"Oh, here we go again",209
2,The voices in his head,209
3,Called the rain to end our days of wild,209
4,The sickest army doll,209
5,Purchased at the mall,209
6,Rivulets descend my plastic smile,209
7,But you should've seen him,209
8,When he first got me,209
9,"My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh",209
10,"I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh",209
11,'Cause it fit too right,209
12,Puzzle pieces in the dead of night,209
13,I should've known it was a matter of time,209
14,"Oh, oh, my boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh-oh-oh",209
15,There was a litany of reasons why,209
16,We could've played for keeps this time,209
17,I know I'm just repeating myself,209
18,Put me back on my shelf,209
19,"But first, pull the string",209
20,And I'll tell you that he runs,209
21,Because he loves me (He loves me),209
22,'Cause you should've seen him,209
23,When he first saw me,209
24,"My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh",209
25,"I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh",209
26,'Cause I knew too much,209
27,There was danger in the heat of my touch,209
28,He saw forever so he smashed it up,209
29,"Oh, oh, my boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh-oh-oh",209
30,"Once I fix me, he's gonna miss me",209
31,"Once I fix me, he's gonna miss me",209
32,"Just say when, I'd play again",209
33,He was my best friend,209
34,Down at the sandlot,209
35,I felt more when we played pretend,209
36,Than with all the Kens,209
37,'Cause he took me out of my box,209
38,Stole my tortured heart,209
39,Left all these broken parts,209
40,Told me I'm better off,209
41,But I'm not,209
42,I'm not,209
43,I'm not,209
