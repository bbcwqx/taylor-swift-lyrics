1,We hereby conduct this post mortem,227
2,He was a hothouse flower to my outdoorsman,227
3,Our maladies were such we could not cure them,227
4,And so a touch that was my birthright became foreign,227
5,"Come one, come all",227
6,It's happening again,227
7,The empathetic hunger descends,227
8,We'll tell no one except all of our friends,227
9,We must know,227
10,How did it end?,227
11,We were blind to unforeseen circumstances,227
12,We learned the right steps to different dances,227
13,And fell victim to interlopers' glances,227
14,"Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?",227
15,Soon they'll go home to their husbands,227
16,Smug 'cause they know they can trust him,227
17,Then feverishly calling their cousins,227
18,Guess who we ran into at the shops,227
19,Walking in circles like she was lost,227
20,Didn't you hear they called it all off,227
21,"One gasp, and then",227
22,How did it end?,227
23,Say it once again with feeling,227
24,How the death rattle breathing,227
25,Silenced as the soul was leaving,227
26,The deflation of our dreaming,227
27,Leaving me bereft and reeling,227
28,My beloved ghost and me,227
29,Sitting in a tree,227
30,D-Y-I-N-G,227
31,It's happening again,227
32,How did it end?,227
33,I can't pretend like I understand,227
34,How did it end?,227
35,"Come one, come all",227
36,It's happening again,227
37,The empathetic hunger descends,227
38,We'll tell no one except all of our friends,227
39,But I still don't know,227
40,How did it end?,227
