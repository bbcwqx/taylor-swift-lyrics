1,The smoke cloud billows out his mouth,217
2,Like a freight train through a small town,217
3,The jokes that he told across the bar,217
4,Were revolting and far too loud,217
5,"They shake their heads, saying, ""God help her"" when I",217
6,Tell 'em he's my man,217
7,But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger,217
8,"I can fix him, no really I can",217
9,And only I can,217
10,The dopamine races through his brain,217
11,On a six-lane Texas highway,217
12,"His hand, so calloused from his pistol",217
13,Softly traces hearts on my face,217
14,And I could see it from a mile away,217
15,A perfect case for my certain skillset,217
16,He had a halo of the highest grade,217
17,He just hadn't met me yet,217
18,"They shake their heads, saying, ""God help her"" when I",217
19,Tell 'em he's my man,217
20,But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger,217
21,"I can fix him, no really I can",217
22,And only I can,217
23,"Good boy, that's right",217
24,"Come close, I'll show you heaven",217
25,If you'll be an angel all night,217
26,"Trust me, I can handle me a dangerous man",217
27,No really I can,217
28,"They shook their heads, saying, ""God help her"" when I",217
29,Told 'em he's my man (I told 'em he's my man),217
30,But your good Lord didn't need to lift a finger,217
31,"I can fix him, no really I can (No really I can)",217
32,"Whoa, maybe I can't",217
