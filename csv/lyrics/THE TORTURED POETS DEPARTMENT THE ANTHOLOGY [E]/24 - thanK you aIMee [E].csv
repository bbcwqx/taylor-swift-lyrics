1,When I picture my hometown,230
2,"There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you",230
3,And a plaque underneath it,230
4,That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school,230
5,And it was always the same searing pain,230
6,But I dreamed that one day I could say,230
7,All that time you were throwin' punches,230
8,I was buildin' somethin',230
9,And I can't forgive the way you made me feel,230
10,"Screamed, 'fucK you aIMee' to the night sky",230
11,As the blood was gushin',230
12,But I can't forget the way you made me heal,230
13,And it wasn't a fair fight,230
14,Or a clean Kill,230
15,Each time that aIMee stomped across my grave,230
16,And then she wrote headlines,230
17,In the local paper laughing at each baby step I'd take,230
18,And it was always the same searing pain,230
19,But I prayed that one day I could say,230
20,All that time you were throwin' punches,230
21,I was buildin' somethin',230
22,And I couldn't wait to show you it was real,230
23,Screamed 'fucK you aIMee' to the night sky,230
24,As the blood was gushin',230
25,But I can't forget the way you made me heal,230
26,Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman,230
27,But she used to say she wished that you were dead,230
28,I pushed each boulder up the hill,230
29,"Your words are still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head",230
30,I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool,230
31,I built a legacy that you can't undo,230
32,But when I count the scars,230
33,There's a moment of truth,230
34,That there wouldn't be this,230
35,If there hadn't been you,230
36,And maybe you've reframed it,230
37,And in your mind you never beat my spirit black and blue,230
38,I don't think you've changed much,230
39,And so I changed your name and any real defining clues,230
40,And one day,230
41,Your kid comes home singing,230
42,A song that only us two is gonna know is about you,230
43,'Cause,230
44,All that time you were throwin' punches,230
45,It was all for nothin',230
46,And our town it looks so small from way up here,230
47,"Screamed, 'thanK you aIMee' to the night sky",230
48,And the stars are stunnin',230
49,'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal,230
50,Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman,230
51,But she used to say she wished that you were dead,230
52,So I pushed each boulder up that hill,230
53,"Your words were still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head",230
54,thanK you aIMee,230
55,thanK you aIMee,230
