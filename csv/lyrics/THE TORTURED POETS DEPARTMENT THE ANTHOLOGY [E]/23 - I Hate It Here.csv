1,"Quick, quick",229
2,Tell me something awful,229
3,Like you are a poet,229
4,Trapped inside the body of a finance guy,229
5,Tell me all your secrets,229
6,All you'll ever be is,229
7,My eternal consolation prize,229
8,"You see, I was a debutante",229
9,"In another life, but",229
10,Now I seem to be scared to go outside,229
11,If comfort is a construct,229
12,I don't believe in good luck,229
13,Now that I know what's what,229
14,"I hate it here, so I will go to",229
15,Secret gardens in my mind,229
16,People need a key to get to,229
17,The only one is mine,229
18,I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child,229
19,No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears,229
20,I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here,229
21,I hate it here,229
22,My friends used to play a game where,229
23,We would pick a decade,229
24,We wished we could live in instead of this,229
25,I'd say the 1830s but without all the racists and getting married off for the highest bid,229
26,Everyone would look down,229
27,'Cause it wasn't fun now,229
28,Seems like it was never even fun back then,229
29,Nostalgia is a mind's trick,229
30,"If I'd been there, I'd hate it",229
31,It was freezing in the palace,229
32,"I hate it here, so I will go to",229
33,Lunar valleys in my mind,229
34,When they found a better planet,229
35,Only the gentle survived,229
36,I dreamed about it in the dark,229
37,The night I felt like I might die,229
38,No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears,229
39,I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here,229
40,I hate it here,229
41,"I'm lonely, but I'm good",229
42,"I'm bitter, but I swear I'm fine",229
43,I'll save all my romanticism for my inner life and I'll get lost on purpose,229
44,This place made me feel worthless,229
45,"Lucid dreams like electricity, the current flies through me and in my fantasies, I rise above it",229
46,"And way up there, I actually love it",229
47,"I hate it here, so I will go to",229
48,Secret gardens in my mind,229
49,People need a key to get to,229
50,The only one is mine,229
51,I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child,229
52,No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears,229
53,I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here,229
54,I hate it here,229
55,"Quick, quick",229
56,Tell me something awful,229
57,Like you are a poet,229
58,Trapped inside the body of a finance guy,229
