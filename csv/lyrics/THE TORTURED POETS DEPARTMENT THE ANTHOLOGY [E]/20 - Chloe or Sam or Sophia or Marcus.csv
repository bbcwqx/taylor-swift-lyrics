1,Your hologram stumbled into my apartment,226
2,Hands in the hair of somebody in darkness,226
3,Named Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus,226
4,And I just watched it happen,226
5,As the decade would play us for fools,226
6,And you saw my bones out with somebody new,226
7,Who seemed like he would've bullied you in school,226
8,And you just watched it happen,226
9,"If you want to break my cold, cold heart",226
10,"Just say, ""I loved you the way that you were""",226
11,If you want to tear my world apart,226
12,Just say you've always wondered,226
13,You said some things that I can't unabsorb,226
14,You turned me into an idea of sorts,226
15,"You needed me, but you needed drugs more",226
16,And I couldn't watch it happen,226
17,"I changed into goddesses, villains, and fools",226
18,Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules,226
19,All to outrun my desertion of you,226
20,And you just watched it,226
21,"If you want to break my cold, cold heart",226
22,"Just say, ""I loved you the way that you were""",226
23,If you want to tear my world apart,226
24,Just say you've always wondered,226
25,If the glint in my eye traced the depths of your sigh,226
26,Down that passage in time,226
27,Back to the moment I crashed into you,226
28,Like so many wrecks do,226
29,Too impaired by my youth,226
30,To know what to do,226
31,So if I sell my apartment,226
32,And you have some kids with an internet starlet,226
33,Will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon?,226
34,Like it never happened,226
35,Could it be enough to just float in your orbit?,226
36,Can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses?,226
37,"Cooler in theory, but not if you force it",226
38,"To be, it just didn't happen",226
39,"So if you want to break my cold, cold heart",226
40,Say you loved me,226
41,And if you want to tear my world apart,226
42,Say you'll always wonder,226
43,'Cause I wonder,226
44,Will I always,226
45,Will I always wonder?,226
