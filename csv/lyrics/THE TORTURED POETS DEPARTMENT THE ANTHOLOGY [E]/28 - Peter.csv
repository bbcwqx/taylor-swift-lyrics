1,"Forgive me, Peter",234
2,My lost fearless leader,234
3,In closets like cedar,234
4,Preserved from when we were just kids,234
5,Is it somethin' I did?,234
6,The goddess of timing,234
7,Once found us beguiling,234
8,She said she was trying,234
9,"Peter, was she lying?",234
10,My ribs get the feelin' she did,234
11,And I didn't want to come down,234
12,I thought it was just goodbye for now,234
13,You said you were gonna grow up,234
14,Then you were gonna come find me,234
15,Said you were gonna grow up,234
16,Then you were gonna come find me,234
17,Said you were gonna grow up,234
18,Then you were gonna come find me,234
19,Words from the mouths of babes,234
20,Promises oceans deep,234
21,But never to keep,234
22,"Oh, never to keep",234
23,Are you still a mind reader?,234
24,A natural scene stealer?,234
25,"I've heard great things, Peter",234
26,But life was always easier on you,234
27,Than it was on me,234
28,And sometimes it gets me,234
29,When crossing your jet stream,234
30,We both did the best we could do underneath the same moon,234
31,In different galaxies,234
32,And I didn't want to hang around,234
33,We said it was just goodbye for now,234
34,You said you were gonna grow up,234
35,Then you were gonna come find me,234
36,Said you were gonna grow up,234
37,Then you were gonna come find me,234
38,Said you were gonna grow up,234
39,Then you were gonna come find me,234
40,Words from the mouths of babes,234
41,Promises oceans deep,234
42,But never to keep,234
43,Never to keep,234
44,And I won't confess that I waited,234
45,But I let the lamp burn,234
46,As the men masqueraded,234
47,I hoped you'd return,234
48,With your feet on the ground,234
49,Tell me all that you'd learned,234
50,'Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned,234
51,"And you said you'd come and get me, but you were twenty-five",234
52,And the shelf life of those fantasies has expired,234
53,Lost to the Lost Boys chapter of your life,234
54,"Forgive me, Peter, please know that I tried",234
55,To hold on to the days when you were mine (Hold on to the days),234
56,But the woman who sits by the window has turned out the light,234
57,You said you were gonna grow up,234
58,Then you were gonna come find me,234
59,Said you were gonna grow up,234
60,You said you were gonna grow up,234
61,Then you were gonna come find me,234
62,Said you were gonna grow up,234
63,You said you were gonna grow up,234
64,Then you were gonna come find me,234
65,Said you were gonna grow up,234
66,Then you were gonna come find me,234
67,Said you were gonna grow up,234
68,Then you were gonna come find me,234
69,Words from the mouths of babes,234
70,Promises oceans deep,234
71,But never to keep,234
