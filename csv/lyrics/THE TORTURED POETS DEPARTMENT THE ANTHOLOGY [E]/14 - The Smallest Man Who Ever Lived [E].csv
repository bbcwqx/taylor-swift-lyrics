1,Was any of it true?,220
2,Gazing at me starry-eyed,220
3,In your Jehovah's Witness suit,220
4,Who the fuck was that guy?,220
5,You tried to buy some pills,220
6,From a friend of friends of mine,220
7,They just ghosted you,220
8,Now you know what it feels like,220
9,"And I don't even want you back, I just want to know",220
10,If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal,220
11,"And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give",220
12,A message to the smallest man who ever lived?,220
13,You hung me on your wall,220
14,Stabbed me with your push pins,220
15,"In public, showed me off",220
16,Then sank in stoned oblivion,220
17,'Cause once your queen had come,220
18,You'd treat her like an also-ran,220
19,You didn't measure up,220
20,In any measure of a man,220
21,"And I don't even want you back, I just want to know",220
22,If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal,220
23,"And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give",220
24,A message to the smallest man who ever lived?,220
25,Were you sent by someone,220
26,Who wanted me dead?,220
27,Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?,220
28,Were you writing a book?,220
29,Were you a sleeper cell spy?,220
30,"In fifty years, will all this be declassified?",220
31,And you'll confess why you did it,220
32,"And I'll say, ""Good riddance""",220
33,'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden,220
34,I would've died for your sins,220
35,Instead I just died inside,220
36,"And you deserve prison, but you won't get time",220
37,You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars,220
38,You crashed my party and your rental car,220
39,"You said normal girls were ""boring""",220
40,But you were gone by the morning,220
41,"You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing",220
42,And in plain sight you hid,220
43,But you are what you did,220
44,"And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive",220
45,The smallest man who ever lived,220
