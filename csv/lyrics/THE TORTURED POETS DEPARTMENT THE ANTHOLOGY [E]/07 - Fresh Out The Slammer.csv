8,Gray and blue and fights and tunnels,213
9,Handcuffed to the spell I was under,213
10,For just one hour of sunshine,213
11,"Years of labor, locks and ceilings",213

22,Watched me daily disappearing,213
23,For just one glimpse of his smile,213
24,All those nights you kept me going,213
25,Swirled you into all of my poems,213
26,"Now we're at the starting line, I did my time",213
27,"Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin'",213
28,To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams,213
29,To the one who says I'm the girl of his American Dreams,213
30,"And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway",213
31,"Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up, now that I know what's at stake",213
32,Here,213
33,At the park where we used to sit on children's swings,213
34,Wearing imaginary rings,213
35,"But it's gonna be alright, I did my time",213
