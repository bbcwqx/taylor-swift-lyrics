1,Wise men once said,225
2,"""Wild winds are death to the candle""",225
3,A rose by any other name is a scandal,225
4,"Cautions issued, he stood",225
5,Shooting the messengers,225
6,They tried to warn him about her,225
7,Cross your thoughtless heart,225
8,Only liquor anoints you,225
9,She's the albatross,225
10,She is here to destroy you,225
11,Wise men once said,225
12,"""One bad seed kills the garden""",225
13,"""One less temptress",225
14,"One less dagger to sharpen""",225
15,Locked me up in towers,225
16,But I'd visit in your dreams,225
17,And they tried to warn you about me,225
18,Cross your thoughtless heart,225
19,Only liquor anoints you,225
20,She's the albatross,225
21,She is here to destroy you,225
22,Devils that you know,225
23,Raise worse hell than a stranger,225
24,She's the death you chose,225
25,You're in terrible danger,225
26,And when that sky rains fire on you,225
27,And you're persona non grata,225
28,I'll tell you how I've been there too,225
29,And that none of it matters,225
30,Wise men once read fake news,225
31,And they believed it,225
32,Jackals raised their hackles,225
33,You couldn't conceive it,225
34,You were sleeping soundly when they dragged you from your bed,225
35,And I tried to warn you about them,225
36,So I crossed my thoughtless heart,225
37,Spread my wings like a parachute,225
38,I'm the albatross,225
39,I swept in at the rescue,225
40,The devil that you know,225
41,Looks now more like an angel,225
42,I'm the life you chose,225
43,And all this terrible danger,225
44,Terrible danger,225
45,So cross your thoughtless heart,225
46,She's the albatross,225
47,She is here to destroy you,225
