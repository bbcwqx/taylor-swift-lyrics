2,"So long, London (So long, London)",211
3,"So long, London (So long, London)",211
4,I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist,211
5,I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift,211
6,Pulled him in tighter each time he was drifting away,211
7,My spine split from carrying us up the hill,211
8,"Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill",211
9,"I stopped trying to make him laugh, stopped trying to drill the safe",211
10,Thinking how much sad did you think I had,211
11,Did you think I had in me?,211
12,"Oh, the tragedy",211
13,"So long, London",211
14,You'll find someone,211
15,I didn't opt in to be your odd man out,211
16,I founded the club she's heard great things about,211
17,"I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath",211
18,"I stopped CPR, after all, it's no use",211
19,"The spirit was gone, we would never come to",211
20,And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free,211
21,"For so long, London",211
22,Stitches undone,211
23,"Two graves, one gun",211
24,I'll find someone,211
25,And you say I abandoned the ship,211
26,But I was going down with it,211
27,My white-knuckle dying grip,211
28,Holding tight to your quiet resentment,211
29,And my friends said it isn't right to be scared,211
30,Every day of a love affair,211
31,Every breath feels like rarest air,211
32,When you're not sure if he wants to be there,211
33,So how much sad did you think I had,211
34,Did you think I had in me?,211
35,How much tragedy?,211
36,Just how low did you think I'd go,211
37,Before I'd self-implode?,211
38,Before I'd have to go be free?,211
39,"You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?",211
40,I died on the altar waiting for the proof,211
41,You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days,211
42,And I'm just getting color back into my face,211
43,I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place,211
44,"For so long, London (So long, London)",211
45,Had a good run (Had a good run),211
46,A moment of warm sun (Moment of warm sun),211
47,But I'm not the one (I'm not the one),211
48,"So long, London (So long, London)",211
49,Stitches undone (Stitches undone),211
50,"Two graves, one gun (Two graves, one gun)",211
51,You'll find someone (You'll find),211
