1,I can read your mind,219
2,"""She's having the time of her life""",219
3,There in her glittering prime,219
4,The lights refract sequin stars,219
5,Off her silhouette every night,219
6,I can show you lies,219
7,'Cause I'm a real tough kid,219
8,I can handle my shit,219
9,"They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it till you make it""",219
10,And I did,219
11,"Lights, camera, bitch, smile",219
12,Even when you want to die,219
13,He said he'd love me all his life,219
14,But that life was too short,219
15,"Breaking down, I hit the floor",219
16,All the pieces of me shattered,219
17,"As the crowd was chanting, ""More!""",219
18,I was grinning like I'm winning,219
19,I was hitting my marks,219
20,'Cause I can do it with a broken heart,219
21,"I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday",219
22,Every day,219
23,"I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me",219
24,Like the plague,219
25,"I cry a lot, but I am so productive",219
26,It's an art,219
27,You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart,219
28,I can hold my breath,219
29,I've been doing it since he left,219
30,I keep finding his things in drawers,219
31,"Crucial evidence, I didn't imagine the whole thing",219
32,I'm sure I can pass this test,219
33,'Cause I'm a real tough kid,219
34,I can handle my shit,219
35,"They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it till you make it""",219
36,And I did,219
37,"Lights, camera, bitch, smile",219
38,In stilettos for miles,219
39,He said he'd love me for all time,219
40,But that time was quite short,219
41,"Breaking down, I hit the floor",219
42,All the pieces of me shattered,219
43,"As the crowd was chanting, ""More!""",219
44,I was grinning like I'm winning,219
45,I was hitting my marks,219
46,'Cause I can do it with a broken heart,219
47,"I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday",219
48,Every day,219
49,"I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me",219
50,Like the plague,219
51,"I cry a lot, but I am so productive",219
52,It's an art,219
53,You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart,219
54,You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart,219
55,"You know you're good, and I'm good",219
56,'Cause I'm miserable!,219
57,And nobody even knows!,219
58,Try and come for my job,219
