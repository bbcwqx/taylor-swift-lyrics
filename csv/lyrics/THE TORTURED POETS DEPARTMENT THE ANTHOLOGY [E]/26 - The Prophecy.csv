1,Hand on the throttle,232
2,Thought I caught lightning in a bottle,232
3,"Oh, but it's gone again",232
4,And it was written,232
5,I got cursed like Eve got bitten,232
6,"Oh, was it punishment?",232
7,Pad around when I get home,232
8,I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope,232
9,A greater woman wouldn't beg,232
10,But I looked to the sky and said,232
11,Please,232
12,I've been on my knees,232
13,Change the prophecy,232
14,Don't want money,232
15,Just someone who wants my company,232
16,Let it once be me,232
17,Who do I have to speak to,232
18,About if they can redo,232
19,The prophecy?,232
20,Cards on the table,232
21,"Mine play out like fools in a fable, oh",232
22,"It was sinking in (Sinking in, oh)",232
23,Slow is the quicksand,232
24,Poison blood from the wound of the pricked hand,232
25,"Oh, still I dream of him",232
26,Please,232
27,I've been on my knees,232
28,Change the prophecy,232
29,Don't want money,232
30,Just someone who wants my company,232
31,Let it once be me,232
32,Who do I have to speak to,232
33,About if they can redo,232
34,The prophecy?,232
35,And I sound like an infant,232
36,Feeling like the very last drops of an ink pen,232
37,A greater woman stays cool,232
38,But I howl like a wolf at the moon,232
39,And I look unstable,232
40,Gathered with a coven round a sorceress' table,232
41,A greater woman has faith,232
42,But even statues crumble if they're made to wait,232
43,I'm so afraid I sealed my fate,232
44,No sign of soulmates,232
45,I'm just a paperweight,232
46,In shades of greige,232
47,Spending my last coin so someone will tell me,232
48,It'll be okay,232
49,Ooh,232
50,Ooh,232
51,Ooh,232
52,Ooh,232
53,Please,232
54,I've been on my knees,232
55,Change the prophecy,232
56,Don't want money,232
57,Just someone who wants my company,232
58,Let it once be me,232
59,Who do I have to speak to,232
60,About if they can redo,232
61,The prophecy?,232
62,Who do I have to speak to,232
63,To change the prophecy?,232
64,Hand on the throttle,232
65,"Thought I caught lightning in a bottle, oh",232
66,But it's gone again,232
67,Pad around when I get home,232
68,I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope,232
69,A greater woman wouldn't beg,232
70,But I looked to the sky and said (Please),232
