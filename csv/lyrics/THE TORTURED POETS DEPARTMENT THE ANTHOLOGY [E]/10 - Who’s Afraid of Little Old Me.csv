1,"The ""Who's Who"" of ""Who's That?""",216
2,Is poised for the attack,216
3,But my bare hands paved their paths,216
4,"You don't get to tell me about ""sad""",216
5,If you wanted me dead,216
6,You should've just said,216
7,Nothing makes me feel more alive,216
8,"So I leap from the gallows, and I levitate down your street",216
9,Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream,216
10,"""Who's afraid of little old me?""",216
11,You should be,216
12,The scandal was contained,216
13,The bullet had just grazed,216
14,"At all costs, keep your good name",216
15,You don't get to tell me you feel bad,216
16,Is it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one more joke,216
17,Then we could all just laugh until I cry,216
18,"So I leap from the gallows, and I levitate down your street",216
19,Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream,216
20,"""Who's afraid of little old me?""",216
21,"I was tame, I was gentle till the circus life made me mean",216
22,"Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth",216
23,Who's afraid of little old me?,216
24,"Well, you should be, you should be, you should be (You should be, you should be)",216
25,"You should be, you should be, you should be (You should be, you should be)",216
26,So tell me everything is not about me,216
27,But what if it is?,216
28,Then say they didn't do it to hurt me,216
29,But what if they did?,216
30,I want to snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me,216
31,You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me,216
32,"So all you kids can sneak into my house, with all the cobwebs",216
33,"I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?",216
34,That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn,216
35,"That I'm fearsome, and I'm wretched, and I'm wrong",216
36,Put narcotics into all of my songs,216
37,And that's why you're still singing along,216
38,"So I leap from the gallows, and I levitate down your street",216
39,Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream,216
40,"""Who's afraid of little old me?""",216
41,"I was tame, I was gentle till the circus life made me mean",216
42,"Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth",216
43,Who's afraid of little old me?,216
44,"Well, you should be, you should be, you should be (You should be, you should be)",216
45,"'Cause you lured me, and you hurt me, and you taught me (You should be, you should be)",216
46,"You caged me, and then you called me crazy",216
47,I am what I am 'cause you trained me,216
48,So who's afraid of me?,216
49,So who's afraid of little old me?,216
50,Who's afraid of little old me?,216
