1,"By all accounts, she almost drowned",235
2,When she was six in frigid water,235
3,And I can confirm she made,235
4,"A curious child, ever reviled",235
5,By everyone except her own father,235
6,With a quite bewitching face,235
7,"Splendidly selfish, charmingly helpless",235
8,Excellent fun till you get to know her,235
9,Then she runs like it's a race,235
10,"Behind her back, her best mates laughed",235
11,And they nicknamed her The Bolter,235
12,Started with a kiss,235
13,"""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""",235
14,But it always ends up with a town car speeding,235
15,Out the drive one evening,235
16,Ended with the slam of a door,235
17,Then he'll call her a whore,235
18,Wish he wouldn't be sore,235
19,But as she was leaving,235
20,It felt like breathing,235
21,All her fuckin' lives,235
22,Flashed before her eyes,235
23,It feels like the time,235
24,She fell through the ice,235
25,Then came out alive,235
26,"He was a cad, wanted her bad",235
27,Just like any good trophy hunter,235
28,And she liked the way it tastes,235
29,"Taming a bear, making him care",235
30,Watching him jump then pulling him under,235
31,"And at first blush, this is fate",235
32,"When it's all roses, portrait poses",235
33,Central Park Lake in tiny rowboats,235
34,What a charming Saturday,235
35,That's when she sees the littlest leaks,235
36,Down in the floorboards,235
37,And she just knows,235
38,She must bolt,235
39,Started with a kiss,235
40,"""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""",235
41,But it always ends up with a town car speeding,235
42,Out the drive one evening,235
43,Ended with the slam of a door,235
44,Then he'll call her a whore,235
45,Wish he wouldn't be sore,235
46,But as she was leaving,235
47,It felt like breathing,235
48,All her fuckin' lives,235
49,Flashed before her eyes,235
50,It feels like the time,235
51,She fell through the ice,235
52,Then came out alive,235
53,She's been many places with,235
54,Men of many faces,235
55,First they're off to the races,235
56,And she's laughing drawin' aces,235
57,But none of it is changin',235
58,That the chariot is waitin',235
59,Hearts are hers for the breakin',235
60,There's escape in escaping,235
61,Started with a kiss,235
62,"""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""",235
63,But it always ends up with a town car speeding,235
64,Out the drive one evening,235
65,Ended with the slam of a door,235
66,But she's got the best stories,235
67,You can be sure,235
68,That as she was leaving,235
69,It felt like freedom,235
70,All her fuckin' lives,235
71,Flashed before her eyes,235
72,And she realized,235
73,It feels like the time,235
74,She fell through the ice,235
75,Then came out alive,235
