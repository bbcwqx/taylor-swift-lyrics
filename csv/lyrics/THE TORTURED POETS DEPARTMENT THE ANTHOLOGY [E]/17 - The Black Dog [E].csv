1,"I am someone who, until recent events",223
2,You shared your secrets with,223
3,And your location,223
4,You forgot to turn it off,223
5,And so I watch as you walk,223
6,Into some bar called The Black Dog,223
7,And pierce new holes in my heart,223
8,You forgot to turn it off,223
9,And it hits me,223
10,I just don't understand,223
11,How you don't miss me,223
12,In The Black Dog,223
13,When someone plays The Starting Line and you jump up,223
14,But she's too young to know this song,223
15,That was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming,223
16,Old habits die screaming,223
17,I move through the world with the heartbroken,223
18,My longings stay unspoken,223
19,And I may never open up the way I did for you,223
20,And all of those best laid plans,223
21,You said I needed a brave man,223
22,Then proceeded to play him,223
23,Until I believed it too,223
24,And it kills me,223
25,I just don't understand,223
26,How you don't miss me,223
27,In the shower,223
28,And remember,223
29,How my rain-soaked body was shaking,223
30,Do you hate me?,223
31,Was it hazing?,223
32,For a cruel fraternity I pledged,223
33,And I still mean it,223
34,Old habits die screaming,223
35,Six weeks of breathing clean air,223
36,I still miss the smoke,223
37,Were you making fun of me with some esoteric joke?,223
38,Now I want to sell my house and set fire to all my clothes,223
39,And hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons,223
40,Even if I die screaming,223
41,And I hope you hear it,223
42,And I hope it's shitty,223
43,In The Black Dog,223
44,When someone plays The Starting Line and you jump up,223
45,But she's too young to know this song,223
46,That was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming,223
47,"'Cause tail between your legs, you're leaving",223
48,And I still can't believe it,223
49,'Cause old habits die screaming,223
