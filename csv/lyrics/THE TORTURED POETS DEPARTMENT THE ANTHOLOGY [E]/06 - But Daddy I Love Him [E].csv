1,I forget how the West was won,212
2,I forget if this was ever fun,212
3,I just learned these people only raise you to cage you,212
4,Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best,212
5,"Clutching their pearls, sighing, ""What a mess""",212
6,I just learned these people try and save you,212
7,'Cause they hate you,212
8,Too high a horse,212
9,For a simple girl to rise above it,212
10,They slammed the door on my whole world,212
11,The one thing I wanted,212
12,Now I'm running with my dress unbuttoned,212
13,"Screaming, ""But Daddy, I love him!",212
14,"I'm having his baby""",212
15,"No, I'm not, but you should see your faces",212
16,I'm telling him to floor it through the fences,212
17,"No, I'm not coming to my senses",212
18,I know he's crazy but he's the one I want,212
19,"Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid",212
20,Tendrils tucked into a woven braid,212
21,Growing up precocious sometimes means not growing up at all,212
22,"He was chaos, he was revelry",212
23,Bedroom eyes like a remedy,212
24,Soon enough the elders had convened,212
25,Down at the city hall,212
26,"""Stay away from her""",212
27,The saboteurs protested too much,212
28,Lord knows the words we never heard,212
29,Just screeching tires and true love,212
30,And I'm running with my dress unbuttoned,212
31,"Screaming, ""But Daddy, I love him!",212
32,"I'm having his baby""",212
33,"No, I'm not, but you should see your faces",212
34,I'm telling him to floor it through the fences,212
35,"No, I'm not coming to my senses",212
36,I know he's crazy but he's the one I want,212
37,I'll tell you something right now,212
38,I'd rather burn my whole life down,212
39,Than listen to one more second of all this bitching and moaning,212
40,I'll tell you something about my good name,212
41,It's mine alone to disgrace,212
42,I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing,212
43,God save the most judgmental creeps,212
44,Who say they want what's best for me,212
45,Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see,212
46,Thinking it can change the beat,212
47,Of my heart when he touches me,212
48,And counteract the chemistry,212
49,And undo the destiny,212
50,You ain't gotta pray for me,212
51,Me and my wild boy and all this wild joy,212
52,If all you want is gray for me,212
53,Then it's just white noise,212
54,And it's just my choice,212
55,There's a lot of people in town that I,212
56,Bestow upon my fakest smiles,212
57,Scandal does funny things to pride,212
58,But brings lovers closer,212
59,We came back when the heat died down,212
60,Went to my parents and they came around,212
61,All the wine moms are still holding out,212
62,"But fuck 'em, it's over",212
63,"Now I'm dancing in my dress in the sun, and",212
64,Even my daddy just loves him,212
65,I'm his lady,212
66,"And oh my God, you should see your faces",212
67,"Time, doesn't it give some perspective?",212
68,"And no, you can't come to the wedding",212
69,"I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want",212
70,"I'll tell you something right now, you ain't gotta pray for me",212
71,Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy,212
72,"He was chaos, he was revelry",212
73,If all you want is gray for me,212
74,"Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice",212
75,"Screaming, ""But Daddy, I love him!",212
76,"I'm having his baby""",212
77,"No, I'm not, but you",212
78,Should see your faces,212
79,"But oh my God, you should see your faces",212
80,"He was chaos, he was revelry",212
