1,I had died the tiniest death,231
2,I spied the catch in your breath,231
3,"Out, out, out, out, out, out",231
4,Northbound I got carried away,231
5,As you boarded your train,231
6,"South, south, south, south, south, south",231
7,A feather taken by the wind blowing,231
8,I'm afflicted by the not knowing so,231
9,I look in people's windows,231
10,Transfixed by rose golden glows,231
11,They have their friends over to drink nice wine,231
12,I look in people's windows,231
13,In case you're at their table,231
14,What if your eyes looked up and met mine,231
15,One more time,231
16,You had stopped and tilted your head,231
17,I still ponder what it meant,231
18,"Now, now, now, now, now, now",231
19,I tried searching faces on streets,231
20,What are the chances you'd be,231
21,"Downtown, downtown, downtown",231
22,Does it feel alright to not know me?,231
23,"I'm addicted to the ""if only""",231
24,So I look in people's windows,231
25,Like I'm some deranged weirdo,231
26,I attend Christmas parties from outside,231
27,I look in people's windows,231
28,In case you're at their table,231
29,What if your eyes looked up and met mine,231
30,One more time,231
