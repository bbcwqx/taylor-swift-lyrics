1,You can beat the heat,214
2,If you beat the charges too,214
3,They said I was a cheat,214
4,I guess it must be true,214
5,And my friends all smell like weed or little babies,214
6,And this city reeks of driving myself crazy,214
7,"Little did you know, your home's really only a town you're just a guest in",214
8,So you work your life away just to pay for a timeshare down in Destin,214
9,Florida!!!,214
10,Is one hell of a drug,214
11,Florida!!!,214
12,Can I use you up?,214
13,"And the hurricane with my name, when it came",214
14,I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away,214
15,Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine,214
16,"Well, me and my ghosts, we had a hell of a time",214
17,"Yes, I'm haunted, but I'm feeling just fine",214
18,All my girls got their lace and their crimes,214
19,"And your cheating husband disappeared, well",214
20,No one asks any questions here,214
21,So I did my best to lay to rest,214
22,All of the bodies that have ever been on my body,214
23,"And in my mind, they sink into the swamp",214
24,Is that a bad thing to say in a song?,214
25,"Little did you know, your home's really only the town you'll get arrested",214
26,So you pack your life away just to wait out the shitstorm back in Texas,214
27,Florida!!!,214
28,Is one hell of a drug,214
29,Florida!!!,214
30,Can I use you up?,214
31,"I need to forget, so take me to Florida",214
32,"I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida",214
33,"Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable",214
34,"At least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up, Florida!",214
35,"I need to forget, so take me to Florida",214
36,"I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida",214
37,"Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable",214
38,"What a crash, what a rush, fuck me up, Florida!",214
39,It's one hell of a drug,214
40,It's one hell of a drug,214
41,Love left me like this,214
42,And I don't want to exist,214
43,So take me to Florida,214
