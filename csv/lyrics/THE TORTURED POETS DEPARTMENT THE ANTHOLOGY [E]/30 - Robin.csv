1,Long may you reign,236
2,You're an animal,236
3,You are bloodthirsty,236
4,Out window panes talking utter nonsense,236
5,You have no idea,236
6,Strings tied to levers,236
7,Slowed-down clocks tethered,236
8,All this showmanship,236
9,To keep it for you,236
10,In sweetness,236
11,"Way to go, tiger",236
12,Higher and higher,236
13,Wilder and lighter,236
14,For you,236
15,Long may you roar,236
16,At your dinosaurs,236
17,You're a just ruler,236
18,"Covered in mud, you look ridiculous",236
19,And you have no idea,236
20,Buried down deep and out of your reach,236
21,The secret we all vowed,236
22,To keep it from you,236
23,In sweetness,236
24,"Way to go, tiger",236
25,Higher and higher,236
26,Wilder and lighter,236
27,For you,236
28,You got the dragonflies above your bed,236
29,You have a favorite spot on the swing set,236
30,You have no room in your dreams for regrets,236
31,You have no idea,236
32,The time will arrive for the cruel and the mean,236
33,You'll learn to bounce back just like your trampoline,236
34,But now we'll curtail your curiosity,236
35,In sweetness,236
36,"Way to go, tiger",236
37,"Way to go, tiger",236
38,Higher and higher,236
39,Higher and higher,236
40,Wilder and lighter,236
41,For you,236
