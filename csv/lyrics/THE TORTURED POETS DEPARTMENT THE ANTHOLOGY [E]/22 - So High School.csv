1,I feel so high school,228
2,Every time I look at you,228
3,I want to find you in a crowd,228
4,Just to hide from you,228
5,And in the blink of a crinklin' eye,228
6,"I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined",228
7,Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights,228
8,Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me,228
9,I'll drink what you think and I'm high,228
10,From smokin' your jokes all damn night,228
11,The brink of a wrinkle in time,228
12,Bittersweet sixteen suddenly,228
13,I'm watchin' American Pie with you on a Saturday night,228
14,"Your friends are around, so be quiet",228
15,I'm tryin' to stifle my sighs,228
16,'Cause I feel so high school,228
17,Every time I look at you,228
18,But look at you,228
19,"Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me? (Kill me)",228
20,"It's just a game, but really (Really)",228
21,I'm bettin' on all three for us two (All three),228
22,"Get my car door, isn't that sweet (That sweet)",228
23,Then pull me to the backseat (Backseat),228
24,"No one's ever had me, not like you (Had me)",228
25,"Truth, dare, spin bottles",228
26,"You know how to ball, I know Aristotle",228
27,"Brand new, full throttle",228
28,Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto,228
29,"It's true, swear, scouts honor",228
30,"You knew what you wanted, and, boy, you got her",228
31,"Brand new, full throttle",228
32,"You already know, babe",228
33,I feel like laughin',228
34,In the middle of practice,228
35,Do that impression you did of your dad again,228
36,"I'm hearin' voices, like a madman",228
37,And in the blink of a crinklin' eye,228
38,"I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined",228
39,Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights,228
40,Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me,228
41,I'll drink what you think and I'm high,228
42,From smokin' your jokes all damn night,228
43,The brink of a wrinkle in time,228
44,Bittersweet sixteen suddenly,228
45,I'm watching American Pie with you on a Saturday night,228
46,"Your friends are around, so be quiet",228
47,I'm tryin' to stifle my sighs,228
48,'Cause I feel so high school,228
49,Every time I look at you,228
50,But look at you,228
51,"Truth, dare, spin bottles",228
52,"You know how to ball, I know Aristotle",228
53,"Brand new, full throttle",228
54,Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto,228
55,"It's true, swear, scouts honor",228
56,"You knew what you wanted, and, boy, you got her",228
