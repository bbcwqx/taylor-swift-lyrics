1,I was in my new house placing daydreams,233
2,Patching up the crack along the wall,233
3,I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying,233
4,'Cause that's where I was when I got the call,233
5,When the first stone's thrown there's screamin',233
6,In the streets there's a ragin' riot,233
7,"When it's, ""Burn the bitch"", they're shriekin'",233
8,When the truth comes out it’s quiet,233
9,So they killed Cassandra first,233
10,'Cause she feared the worst,233
11,And tried to tell the town,233
12,"So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say",233
13,Do you believe me now?,233
14,I was in my tower weaving nightmares,233
15,Twisting all my smiles into snarls,233
16,They say what doesn’t kill you makes you aware,233
17,What happens if it becomes who you are?,233
18,So they killed Cassandra first,233
19,'Cause she feared the worst,233
20,And tried to tell the town,233
21,"So they set my life in flames, I regret to say",233
22,Do you believe me now?,233
23,"They knew, they knew, they knew the whole time",233
24,That I was onto somethin',233
25,"The family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line",233
26,They all said nothin',233
27,"Blood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll",233
28,Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul,233
29,You can mark my words that I said it first,233
30,In a mourning warning no one heard,233
31,I patched up the crack along the wall,233
32,I pass it and lose track of what I’m saying,233
33,'Cause that's where I was when I lost it all,233
34,So they killed Cassandra first,233
35,'Cause she feared the worst,233
36,And tried to tell the town,233
37,"So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say",233
38,Do you believe me now?,233
39,I was onto somethin',233
40,They all said nothin',233
41,"Blood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll",233
42,Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul,233
43,You can mark my words that I said it first,233
44,In a mourning warning no one heard,233
45,No one heard,233
46,Not a single word was heard,233
47,When the first stone's thrown there's screamin',233
48,In the streets there's a ragin' riot,233
49,"When it's, ""Burn the bitch"", they're shriekin'",233
50,When the truth comes out it’s quiet,233
51,It’s so quiet,233
