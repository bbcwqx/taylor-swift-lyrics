1,Daisy's bare naked,246
2,I was distraught,246
3,He loves me not,246
4,He loves me not,246
5,Penny's unlucky,246
6,I took him back and then,246
7,Stepped on a crack,246
8,And the black cat laughed,246
9,"And baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious (Superstitious)",246
10,Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine,246
11,"Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck",246
12,A bad sign is all good,246
13,I ain't gotta knock on wood,246
14,"All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star",246
15,Never did me any good,246
16,I ain't got to knock on wood,246
17,It's you and me forever dancing in the dark,246
18,"All over me, it's understood",246
19,I ain't got to knock on wood,246
20,"Forgive me, it sounds cocky",246
21,He (Ah!)matized me,246
22,And opened my eyes,246
23,Redwood tree,246
24,It ain't hard to see,246
25,His love was the key,246
26,That opened my thighs,246
27,"Girls, I don't need to catch the bouquet",246
28,To know a hard rock is on the way,246
29,"And baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious (Superstitious)",246
30,The curse on me was broken by your magic wand,246
31,"Seems to me that you and me, we make our own luck",246
32,"New Heights of manhood (New Heights, manhood)",246
33,I ain't gotta knock on wood,246
34,"All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star",246
35,Never did me any good,246
36,I ain't got to knock on wood,246
37,It's you and me forever dancing in the dark,246
38,"All over me, it's understood",246
39,I ain't got to knock on wood,246
40,"Forgive me, it sounds cocky",246
41,He (Ah!)matized me,246
42,And opened my eyes,246
43,Redwood tree,246
44,It ain't hard to see,246
45,His love was the key,246
46,That opened my thighs,246
47,"Forgive me, it sounds cocky",246
48,He (Ah!)matized me,246
49,And opened my eyes,246
50,Redwood tree,246
51,It ain't hard to see,246
52,His love was the key,246
53,That opened my thighs,246
