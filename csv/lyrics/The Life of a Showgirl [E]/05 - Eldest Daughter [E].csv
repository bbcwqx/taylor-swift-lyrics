1,Everybody's so punk on the internet,242
2,Everyone's unbothered till they're not,242
3,Every joke's just trolling and memes,242
4,"Sad as it seems, apathy is hot",242
5,Everybody's cutthroat in the comments,242
6,Every single hot take is cold as ice,242
7,"When you found me, I said I was busy",242
8,That was a lie,242
9,I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness,242
10,I've been dying just from trying to seem cool,242
11,But I'm not a bad bitch,242
12,And this isn't savage,242
13,But I'm never gonna let you down,242
14,I'm never gonna leave you out,242
15,So many traitors,242
16,Smooth operators,242
17,But I'm never gonna break that vow,242
18,"I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now",242
19,"You know, the last time I laughed this hard was",242
20,On the trampoline in somebody's backyard,242
21,I must've been about eight or nine,242
22,That was the night,242
23,I fell off and broke my arm,242
24,"Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion",242
25,When your first crush crushes something kind,242
26,When I said I don't believe in marriage,242
27,That was a lie,242
28,Every eldest daughter,242
29,Was the first lamb to the slaughter,242
30,So we all dressed up as wolves and we looked fire,242
31,But I'm not a bad bitch,242
32,And this isn't savage,242
33,But I'm never gonna let you down,242
34,I'm never gonna leave you out,242
35,So many traitors,242
36,Smooth operators,242
37,But I'm never gonna break that vow,242
38,"I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now",242
39,We lie back,242
40,"A beautiful, beautiful time lapse",242
41,"Ferris wheels, kisses, and lilacs",242
42,And things I said were dumb,242
43,"'Cause I thought that I'd never find that beautiful, beautiful life that",242
44,Shimmers that innocent light back,242
45,Like when we were young,242
46,Every youngest child felt,242
47,They were raised up in the wild,242
48,But now you're home,242
49,'Cause I'm not a bad bitch,242
50,And this isn't savage,242
51,And I'm never gonna let you down,242
52,I'm never gonna leave you out,242
53,So many traitors,242
54,Smooth operators,242
55,But I'm never gonna break that vow (Never gonna break that vow),242
56,"I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now",242
57,Never gonna break that vow,242
58,"Never gonna leave you now, now",242
59,I'm never gonna leave you now,242
