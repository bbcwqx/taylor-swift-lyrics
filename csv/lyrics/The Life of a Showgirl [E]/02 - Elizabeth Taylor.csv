2,Do you think it's forever?,239
3,That view of Portofino was on my mind when you called me at the Plaza Athénée,239
4,"Ooh, oftentimes it doesn't feel so glamorous to be me",239
5,All the right guys,239
6,Promised they'd stay,239
7,Under bright lights,239
8,They withered away,239
9,But you bloom,239
10,Portofino was on my mind,239
11,And I think you know why,239

21,"Been number one, but I never had two",239
22,And I can't have fun if I can't have you,239
23,"Hey, what could you possibly get for the girl who has everything and nothing all at once?",239
24,"Babe, I would trade the Cartier for someone to trust (Just kidding)",239
25,We hit the best booth at Musso and Frank's,239
26,"They say I'm bad news, I just say, ""Thanks""",239
27,And you look at me like you're hypnotized,239
28,And I think you know why,239
29,And if you ever leave me high and dry,239
30,I'd cry my eyes violet,239
31,Elizabeth Taylor,239
32,Tell me for real,239
