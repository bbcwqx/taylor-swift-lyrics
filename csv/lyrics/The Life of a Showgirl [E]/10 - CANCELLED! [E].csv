12,And poison thorny flowers,247
13,Welcome to my underworld,247
14,Where it gets quite dark,247

32,They're the ones with matching scars,247
33,They stood by me,247
34,Before my exoneration,247
35,They believed I was innocent,247
36,"So I'm not here for judgment, no…",247
37,But if you can't be good,247
38,Then just be better at it,247
39,Everyone's got bodies in the attic,247
40,Or took somebody's man,247
41,We'll take you by the hand,247
42,And soon you'll learn the art,247

54,Now they've broken you like they've broken me,247
55,But a shattered glass,247
56,Is a lot more sharp,247
57,And now you know exactly who your friends are,247
58,You know who we are,247
59,We're the ones with matching scars,247
