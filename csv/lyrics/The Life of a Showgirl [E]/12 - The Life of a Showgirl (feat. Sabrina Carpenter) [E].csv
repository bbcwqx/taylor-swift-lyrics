1,Her name was Kitty,249
2,Made her money being pretty and witty,249
3,They gave her the keys to this city,249
4,"Then they said she didn't do it legitly, oh",249
5,I bought a ticket,249
6,She's dancing in her garters and fishnets,249
7,"50 in the cast, zero missteps",249
8,"Looking back, I guess it was kismet",249
9,I waited by the stage door,249
10,Packed in with the autograph hounds,249
11,Barking her name,249
12,Then glowing like the end of a cigarette,249
13,"Wow, she came out",249
14,"I said, ""You're living my dream""",249
15,Then she said to me,249
16,"""Hey, thank you for the lovely bouquet",249
17,You're sweeter than a peach,249
18,"But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe",249
19,"And you're never, ever gonna",249
20,"Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay",249
21,You're softer than a kitten so,249
22,"You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe",249
23,"And you're never gonna wanna""",249
24,She was a menace,249
25,The baby of the family in Lenox,249
26,Her father whored around like all men did,249
27,Her mother took pills and played tennis,249
28,So she waited by the stage door,249
29,As the club promoter arrived,249
30,"She said, ""I'd sell my soul to have a taste of a magnificent life that's all mine""",249
31,But that's not what showgirls get,249
32,They leave us for dead,249
33,"Hey, thank you for the lovely bouquet",249
34,You're sweeter than a peach,249
35,"But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe",249
36,"And you're never, ever gonna",249
37,"Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay",249
38,You're softer than a kitten so,249
39,"You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe",249
40,And you're never gonna wanna,249
41,I took her pearls of wisdom,249
42,Hung them from my neck,249
43,I paid my dues with every bruise,249
44,I knew what to expect,249
45,Do you wanna take a skate on the ice inside my veins?,249
46,They ripped me off like false lashes,249
47,And then threw me away,249
48,And all the headshots on the walls,249
49,Of the dance hall are of the bitches,249
50,Who wish I'd hurry up and die,249
51,"But I'm immortal now, baby dolls",249
52,I couldn't if I tried,249
53,So I say,249
54,"""Thank you for the lovely bouquet",249
55,I'm married to the hustle,249
56,"And now I know the life of a showgirl, babe",249
57,And I'll never know another,249
58,Pain hidden by the lipstick and lace (Lipstick and lace),249
59,"Sequins are forever and now I know the life of a showgirl, babe",249
60,"Wouldn't have it any other way""",249
61,Thank you for the lovely bouquet,249
62,Wouldn't have it any other way,249
63,Thank you for the lovely bouquet,249
64,Hey Kitty,249
65,Thank you for the lovely bouquet,249
66,Now I make my money being pretty and witty,249
67,Thank you for the lovely bouquet,249
68,Thank you for an unforgettable night,249
69,We will see you next time,249
70,Give it up for the band,249
71,And the dancers,249
72,"And of course, Sabrina",249
73,"I love you, Taylor",249
74,That's our show,249
75,We love you so much,249
76,Goodnight,249
