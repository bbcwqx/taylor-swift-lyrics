1,Glistening grass from September rain,243
2,Gray overpass full of neon names,243
3,You drive 85,243
4,Gallatin Road and the lakeside beach,243
5,Watching the game from your brother's Jeep,243
6,"Your smile, miles wide",243
7,And it was not an invitation,243
8,Should've kissed you anyway,243
9,Should've kissed you anyway,243
10,"And it was not convenient, no",243
11,But your girlfriend was away,243
12,"Should've kissed you anyway, hey",243
13,Shiny wood floors underneath my feet,243
14,Disco ball makes everything look cheap,243
15,"Have fun, it's prom",243
16,Wilted corsage dangles from my wrist,243
17,"Over his shoulder, I catch a glimpse",243
18,And see you looking at me,243
19,And it was not an invitation,243
20,But as the 50 Cent song played (Song played),243
21,Should've kissed you anyway (Anyway),243
22,"And it was not convenient, no (It was not convenient)",243
23,Would've been the best mistake,243
24,"Should've kissed you anyway, hey",243
25,Don't make it awkward in second period,243
26,"Might piss your ex off, lately we've been good",243
27,"Staying friends is safe, doesn't mean you should",243
28,Don't make it awkward in second period,243
29,"Might piss your ex off, lately we've been good",243
30,"Staying friends is safe, doesn't mean you should",243
31,"When I left school, I lost track of you",243
32,Abigail called me with the bad news,243
33,"Goodbye, and we'll never know why",243
34,It was not an invitation,243
35,But I flew home anyway,243
36,With so much left to say,243
37,"It was not convenient, no",243
38,But I whispered at the grave,243
39,"""Should've kissed you anyway""",243
40,"Oh, and it was not an invitation (It was not an invitation)",243
41,Should've kissed you anyway (Anyway),243
42,"Should've kissed you anyway, anyway (Anyway)",243
43,And it was not—,243
44,My advice is always ruin the friendship,243
45,Better that than regret it for all time,243
46,Should've kissed you anyway,243
47,And my advice is always answer the question,243
48,Better that than to ask it all your life,243
49,Should've kissed you anyway,243
50,Should've kissed you anyway,243
