1,I had a bad habit,240
2,Of missing lovers past,240
3,My brother used to call it,240
4,"""Eating out of the trash,"" it's never gonna last",240
5,I thought my house was haunted,240
6,I used to live with ghosts,240
7,And all the perfect couples,240
8,"Said, ""When you know you know and when you don't you don't""",240
9,And all of the foes and all of the friends,240
10,"Have seen it before, they'll see it again",240
11,"Life is a song, it ends when it ends",240

13,"But my Mama told me, ""It's alright",240
14,You were dancing through the lightning strikes,240

16,But now the sky is opalite,240
17,"Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh my Lord",240
18,Never made no one like you before,240

20,"But now the sky is opalite""",240
21,"Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh",240

23,Why you felt alone,240
24,You were in it for real,240
25,"She was in her phone, and you were just a pose",240
26,And don't we try to love love? (Love love),240
27,We give it all we got (Give it all we got),240
28,You finally left the table,240
29,"And what a simple thought, you're starving till you're not",240
30,And all of the foes and all of the friends,240
31,"Have messed up before, they'll mess up again",240
32,"Life is a song, it ends when it ends",240
33,You move on,240
34,"And that's when I told you, ""It's alright",240
35,You were dancing through the lightning strikes,240
36,Sleepless in the onyx night,240
37,But now the sky is opalite,240
38,"Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh my Lord",240
39,Never met no one like you before,240
40,You had to make your own sunshine,240
41,"But now the sky is opalite""",240
42,"Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh",240
43,This is just a storm inside a teacup,240
44,"But shelter here with me, my love",240
45,Thunder like a drum,240
46,"This life will beat you up, up, up, up",240
47,This is just a temporary speed bump,240
48,But failure brings you freedom,240

50,"Don't you sweat it, baby",240
51,"""It's alright",240
52,You were dancing through the lightning strikes,240
53,"Oh, so sleepless in the onyx night",240
54,But now the sky is opalite,240
55,"Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh my Lord",240
56,Never met no one like you before,240
57,You had to make your own sunshine,240
58,"But now the sky is opalite""",240
59,"Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh",240
