1,We were crazy to think,144
2,Crazy to think that this could work,144
3,Remember how I said I'd die for you?,144
4,We were stupid to jump,144
5,In the ocean separating us,144
6,Remember how I'd fly to you?,144
7,And I can't talk to you when you're like this,144
8,Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town,144
9,I'm New York City,144
10,"I still do it for you, babe",144
11,They all warned us about times like this,144
12,They said the road gets hard,144
13,And you get lost when you're led by blind faith,144
14,Blind faith,144
15,But we might just get away with it,144
16,Religion's in your lips,144
17,"Even if it's a false god, we'd still worship",144
18,We might just get away with it,144
19,The altar is my hips,144
20,Even if it's a false god,144
21,We'd still worship this love,144
22,We'd still worship this love,144
23,We'd still worship this lo-o-o-o-ove,144
24,I know Heaven's a thing,144
25,"I go there when you touch me, honey",144
26,Hell is when I fight with you,144
27,But we can patch it up good,144
28,"Make confessions, and we're begging for forgiveness",144
29,Got the wine for you,144
30,And you can't talk to me when I'm like this,144
31,"Daring you to leave me, just so I can try and scare you",144
32,You're the West Village,144
33,"You still do it for me, babe",144
34,They all warned us about times like this,144
35,They said the road gets hard,144
36,And you get lost when you're led by blind faith,144
37,Blind faith,144
38,But we might just get away with it,144
39,Religion's in your lips,144
40,"Even if it's a false god, we'd still worship",144
41,We might just get away with it,144
42,The altar is my hips,144
43,Even if it's a false god,144
44,We'd still worship this love,144
45,We'd still worship this love,144
46,We'd still worship this lo-o-o-o-ove,144
47,Still worship this love,144
48,Even if it's a false god,144
49,Even if it's a false god,144
50,Still worship this love,144
