1,Combat,136
2,I'm ready for combat,136
3,I say I don't want that,136
4,But what if I do?,136
5,'Cause cruelty,136
6,Wins in the movies,136
7,I've got a hundred thrown out speeches I almost said to you,136
8,"Easy they come, easy they go",136
9,I jump from the train,136
10,I ride off alone,136
11,I never grew up,136
12,It's getting so old,136
13,Help me hold on to you,136
14,I've been the archer,136
15,I've been the prey,136
16,"Who could ever leave me, darling?",136
17,But who could stay?,136
18,Dark side,136
19,I search for your dark side,136
20,"But what if I'm all right, right, right, right here?",136
21,And I cut off,136
22,My nose just to spite my face,136
23,And I hate my reflection,136
24,For years and years,136
25,I wake in the night,136
26,I pace like a ghost,136
27,The room is on fire,136
28,Invisible smoke,136
29,And all of my heroes,136
30,Die all alone,136
31,Help me hold on to you,136
32,I've been the archer,136
33,I've been the prey,136
34,"Screaming, ""Who could ever leave me darling?",136
35,"But who could stay?"" (I see right through me, I see right through me)",136
36,'Cause they see right through me,136
37,They see right through me,136
38,They see right through,136
39,Can you see right through me?,136
40,They see right through,136
41,They see right through me,136
42,I see right through me,136
43,I see right through me,136
44,"All the king's horses, all the king's men",136
45,Couldn't put me together again,136
46,'Cause all of my enemies started out friends,136
47,Help me hold on to you,136
48,I've been the archer,136
49,I've been the prey,136
50,"Who could ever leave me, darling?",136
51,But who could stay?,136
52,Who could stay?,136
53,Who could stay?,136
54,Who could stay?,136
55,You could stay,136
56,You could stay,136
57,Combat,136
58,I'm ready for combat,136
