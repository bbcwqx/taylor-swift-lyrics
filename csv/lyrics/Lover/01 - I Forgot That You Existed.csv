1,How many days did I spend,132
2,"Thinking 'bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong",132
3,Lived in the shade you were throwing,132
4,"Till all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone",132
5,And I couldn't get away from ya,132
6,"In my feelings more than Drake's, so yeah",132
7,"Your name on my lips, tongue tied",132
8,"Free rent, living in my mind",132
9,But then something happened one magical night,132
10,I forgot that you existed,132
11,"And I thought it would kill me, but it didn't",132
12,And it was so nice,132
13,So peaceful and quiet,132
14,I forgot that you existed,132
15,"It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference",132
16,I forgot that you,132
17,Got out some popcorn,132
18,"As soon as my rep started going down, down, down",132
19,Laughed on the school yard,132
20,"As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground",132
21,And I would've stuck around for ya,132
22,"Would've fought the whole town, so yeah",132
23,"Would've been right there, front row",132
24,Even if nobody came to your show,132
25,"But you showed who you are, then one magical night",132
26,I forgot that you existed,132
27,"And I thought it would kill me, but it didn't",132
28,And it was so nice,132
29,So peaceful and quiet,132
30,I forgot that you existed,132
31,"It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference",132
32,I forgot that you,132
33,Sent me a clear message,132
34,Taught me some hard lessons,132
35,I just forget what they were,132
36,It's all just a blur,132
37,I forgot that you existed,132
38,And I thought it would kill me but it didn't,132
39,And it was so nice,132
40,So peaceful and quiet,132
41,I forgot that you existed,132
42,"I did, I did, I did, it isn't hate, it's just indifference",132
43,"It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference, so yeah",132
