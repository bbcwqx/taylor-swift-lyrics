1,You know I adore you,138
2,I'm crazier for you,138
3,Than I was at 16,138
4,Lost in a film scene,138
5,Waving homecoming queens,138
6,Marching band playing,138
7,I'm lost in the lights,138
8,American glory,138
9,Faded before me,138
10,Now I'm feeling hopeless,138
11,Ripped up my prom dress,138
12,Running through rose thorns,138
13,I saw the scoreboard,138
14,And ran for my life,138
15,No cameras catch my pageant smile,138
16,"I counted days, I counted miles",138
17,"To see you there, to see you there",138
18,"It's been a long time coming, but",138
19,"It's you and me, that's my whole world",138
20,"They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl""",138
21,Okay,138
22,The whole school is rolling fake dice,138
23,"You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes",138
24,"It's you and me, there's nothing like this",138
25,Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince,138
26,Okay,138
27,"We're so sad, we paint the town blue",138
28,Voted most likely to run away with you,138
29,My team is losing,138
30,Battered and bruising,138
31,I see the high fives,138
32,Between the bad guys,138
33,Leave with my head hung,138
34,You are the only one,138
35,Who seems to care,138
36,American stories,138
37,Burning before me,138
38,I'm feeling helpless,138
39,The damsels are depressed,138
40,"Boys will be boys, then",138
41,Where are the wise men?,138
42,"Darling, I'm scared",138
43,No cameras catch my muffled cries,138
44,"I counted days, I counted miles",138
45,"To see you there, to see you there",138
46,"And now the storm is coming, but",138
47,"It's you and me, that's my whole world",138
48,"They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl""",138
