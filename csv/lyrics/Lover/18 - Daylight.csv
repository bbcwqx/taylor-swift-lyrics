1,My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in,149
2,Everyone looked worse in the light,149
3,There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven,149
4,"I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye",149
5,I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you,149
6,I don't wanna think of anything else now that I've thought of you,149
7,I've been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night,149
8,And now I see daylight,149
9,I only see daylight,149
10,Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky,149
11,And so I became the butt of the joke,149
12,I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked,149
13,"Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke",149
14,Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down,149
15,Maybe I stormed out of every single room in this town,149
16,Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now,149
17,"It's brighter now, now",149
18,I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you (I could never look away),149
19,I don't wanna think of anything else now that I've thought of you (Things will never be the same),149
20,I've been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night (Now I'm wide-awake),149
21,And now I see daylight (Daylight),149
22,I only see daylight (Daylight),149
23,"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight",149
24,"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight",149
25,And I can still see it all (In my mind),149
26,"All of you, all of me (Intertwined)",149
27,I once believed love would be (Black and white),149
28,But it's golden (Golden),149
29,And I can still see it all (In my head),149
30,Back and forth from New York (Sneakin' in your bed),149
31,I once believed love would be (Burning red),149
32,But it's golden,149
33,Daylight,149
34,Like daylight,149
35,Like daylight,149
36,Daylight,149
37,I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you (I could never look away),149
38,And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I've thought of you (Things will never be the same),149
39,I've been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night (Now I'm wide-awake),149
40,And now I see daylight (See daylight),149
41,I only see daylight (Oh),149
42,"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight",149
43,"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight",149
44,"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight",149
45,"I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight",149
46,Like daylight,149
47,It's golden like daylight,149
48,You've gotta step into the daylight,149
49,And let it go,149
50,Just let it go,149
51,Let it go,149
52,I wanna be defined by the things that I love,149
53,Not the things I hate,149
54,"Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of",149
55,"The things that haunt me in the middle of the night, I",149
56,I just think that,149
57,You are what you love,149
