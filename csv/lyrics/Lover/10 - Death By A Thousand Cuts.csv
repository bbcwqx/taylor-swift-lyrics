9,Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts,141
10,Flashbacks waking me up,141
11,"I get drunk, but it's not enough",141
12,"'Cause the morning comes, and you're not my baby",141
13,I look through the windows of this love,141
14,Even though we boarded them up,141
15,Chandelier's still flickering here,141
16,'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not,141
17,It's death by a thousand cuts,141
18,I dress to kill my time,141

25,The only thing we share,141
26,Is this small town,141
27,You said it was a great love,141
28,One for the ages,141
29,But if the story's over,141
30,Why am I still writing pages?,141
31,'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts,141

39,It's death by a thousand cuts,141
40,"My heart, my hips, my body, my love",141
41,Trying to find a part of me that you didn't touch,141
42,Gave up on me like I was a bad drug,141
43,Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club,141
44,"Our songs, our films, united we stand",141
45,"Our country, guess it was a lawless land",141
46,Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand,141
47,Paper cut stings from my paper-thin plans,141
48,"My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust",141
49,Trying to find a part of me you didn't take up,141
50,"Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough",141
51,"But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts",141

59,It's death by a thousand cuts,141
60,Trying to find a part of me that you didn't touch,141
61,"My body, my love",141
62,It's death by a thousand cuts,141
63,"But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no",141
