1,I could go back,32
2,To every laugh,32
3,But I don't wanna go there anymore and I,32
4,Know all the steps,32
5,Up to your door,32
6,But I don't wanna go there anymore,32
7,"Talk to the wind, talk to the sky",32
8,Talk to the man with the reasons why,32
9,Let me know what you find,32
10,I'll leave my window open,32
11,'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name,32
12,Just know I'm right here hoping,32
13,That you'll come in with the rain,32
14,I could stand up,32
15,And sing you a song,32
16,But I don't wanna have to go that far and I,32
17,I've got you down,32
18,I know you by heart,32
19,And you don't even know where I start,32
20,"Talk to yourself, talk to the tears",32
21,Talk to the man who put you here,32
22,And don't wait for the sky to clear,32
23,I'll leave my window open,32

26,That you'll come in with the rain,32
27,"I've watched you so long, screamed your name",32
28,I don't know what else I can say,32
29,I'll leave my window open,32
30,'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games,32
31,Just know I'm right here hoping,32
32,That you'll come in with the rain,32
33,I could go back,32
34,To every laugh,32
35,But I don't wanna go there anymore,32
