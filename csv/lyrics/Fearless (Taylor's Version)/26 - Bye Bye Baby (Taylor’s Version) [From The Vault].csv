1,It wasn't just like a movie,41
2,The rain didn't soak through my clothes,41
3,Down to my skin,41
4,I'm driving away and I,41
5,I guess you could say,41
6,This is the last time I'll drive this way again,41
7,Lost in the gray and I,41
8,Try to grab at the fray 'cause I,41
9,I still love you but I can't,41
10,Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side,41
11,"Bye bye, baby",41
12,"I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing",41
13,And all I have is your sympathy,41
14,"'Cause you took me home, but you just couldn't keep me",41
15,"Bye bye, baby",41
16,"Bye bye, baby",41
17,The picture frame is empty,41
18,"On the dresser, vacant just like me",41
19,I see your writing on the dash,41
20,"Then back to your hesitation, I was so sure of everything",41
21,Everything I thought we'd always have,41
22,Guess I never doubted it,41
23,Then the here and the now floods in,41
24,Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past,41
25,Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side,41
26,"Bye bye, baby",41
27,"I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing",41
28,And all I have is your sympathy,41
29,"'Cause you took me home, but you just couldn't keep me",41
30,"Bye bye, baby",41
31,"There's so much that I can't touch, you're all I want",41
32,But it's not enough this time,41
33,And all the pages are just slipping through my hands and I'm so,41
34,Scared of how this ends,41
35,Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side,41
36,"Bye bye, baby",41
37,"I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing",41
38,And all I have is your sympathy,41
39,"'Cause you took me home, but you just couldn't keep me",41
40,Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side,41
41,Bye bye baby,41
42,"I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing",41
43,And all I have is your sympathy,41
44,"'Cause you took me home, but you just couldn't keep me",41
45,"Oh, you took me home",41
46,I thought you were gonna keep me,41
47,"Bye bye, baby",41
48,"Bye bye, baby",41
