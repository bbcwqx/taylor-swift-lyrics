1,Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement,36
2,Shouldn't I find a stain? But I never do,36
3,"The way the tires turn stones, on old county roads",36
4,They leave 'em muddy underneath,36
5,Reminds me of you,36
6,You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls,36
7,"You know, you can scratch it right off",36
8,It's how it used to be,36
9,But like the dollar in your pocket that's been spent and traded in,36
10,You can't change where it's been,36
11,Reminds me of me,36
12,I lived and I learned,36
13,"Had you, got burned",36
14,"Held out, and held on",36
15,"God knows, too long",36
16,"And wasted time, lost tears",36
17,Swore that I'd get out of here,36
18,But no amount of freedom gets you clean,36
19,I've still got you all over me,36
20,The best and worst day of June,36
21,Was the one that I met you,36
22,With your hands in your pockets,36
23,"And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin",36
24,"But I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child",36
25,Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then,36
26,And I lived and I learned,36
27,"Had you, got burned",36
28,Held out and held on,36
29,"God knows, too long",36
30,"And wasted time, lost tears",36
31,Swore that I'd get out of here,36
32,But no amount of freedom gets you clean,36
33,I've still got you all over me,36
34,I lived and I learned,36
35,And found out what it was to turn around,36
36,And see that we,36
37,Were never really meant to be,36
38,So I lied and I cried,36
39,And I watched a part of myself die,36
40,'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean,36
41,I've still got you all over me,36
42,I've still got you all over me,36
43,Still got you all over me,36
