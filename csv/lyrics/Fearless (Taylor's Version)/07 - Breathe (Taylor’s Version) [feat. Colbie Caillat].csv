1,I see your face in my mind as I drive away,22
2,'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way,22
3,People are people and sometimes we change our minds,22
4,But it's killing me to see you go after all this time,22
5,"Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm",22
6,"Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm",22
7,The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie,22
8,It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see,22
9,'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,22
10,Now I don't know what to be without you around,22
11,"And we know it's never simple, never easy",22
12,"Never a clean break, no one here to save me",22
13,You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,22
14,"And I can't breathe without you, but I have to",22
15,"Breathe without you, but I have to",22
16,"Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt",22
17,"Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve",22
18,But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out,22
19,And nothing we say is gonna save us from the fallout,22
20,"And we know it's never simple, never easy",22
21,"Never a clean break, no one here to save me",22
22,You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,22
23,"And I can't breathe without you, but I have to",22

32,"Breathe without you, but I have to",22
33,"Breathe without you, but I have to",22
