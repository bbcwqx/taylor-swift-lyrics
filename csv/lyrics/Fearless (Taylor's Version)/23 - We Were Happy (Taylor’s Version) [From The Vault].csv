1,We used to walk along the streets,38
2,When the porch lights were shining bright,38
3,Before I had somewhere to be,38
4,Back when we had all night,38
5,And we were happy,38
6,"I do recall, a good while back",38
7,We snuck into the circus,38
8,You threw your arms around my neck,38
9,Back when I deserved it,38
10,And we were happy,38
11,"When it was good, baby",38
12,"It was good, baby",38
13,We showed 'em all up,38
14,No one could touch the way we,38
15,Laughed in the dark,38
16,Talking 'bout your daddy's farm,38
17,We were gonna buy someday,38
18,And we were happy,38
19,We used to watch the sun go down,38
20,On the boats in the water,38
21,That's sorta how I feel right now,38
22,And goodbye's so much harder,38
23,'Cause we were happy,38
24,"When it was good, baby",38
25,"It was good, baby",38
26,We showed 'em all up,38
27,No one could touch the way we,38
28,Laughed in the dark,38
29,Talking 'bout your daddy's farm,38
30,We were gonna buy someday,38
31,And we were happy,38
32,We were happy,38
33,"Oh, I hate those voices",38
34,Telling me I'm not in love anymore,38
35,But they don't give me choices,38
36,And that's what these tears are for,38
37,'Cause we were happy,38
38,We were happy,38
39,"When it was good, baby",38
40,"It was good, baby",38
41,We showed 'em all up,38
42,No one could touch the way we,38
43,Laughed in the dark,38
44,Talking 'bout your daddy's farm,38
45,You were gonna marry me,38
46,And we were happy,38
47,We were happy,38
48,"Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, we were happy",38
