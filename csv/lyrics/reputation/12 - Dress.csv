1,Our secret moments in a crowded room,128
2,They got no idea about me and you,128
3,There is an indentation in the shape of you,128
4,"Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo",128
5,"All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation",128
6,"My hands are shaking from holding back from you, ah, ah, ah",128
7,"All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting",128
8,"My hands are shaking from all this, ah, ah, ah, ah",128
9,Say my name and everything just stops,128
10,I don't want you like a best friend,128
11,Only bought this dress so you could take it off,128
12,"Take it off, ha, ha, ha",128
13,Carve your name into my bedpost,128
14,'Cause I don't want you like a best friend,128
15,Only bought this dress so you could take it off,128
16,"Take it off, ha, ha, ha",128
17,"Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try",128
18,"And if I get burned, at least we were electrified",128
19,I'm spilling wine in the bathtub,128
20,You kiss my face and we're both drunk,128
21,Everyone thinks that they know us,128
22,But they know nothing about,128
23,"All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation",128
24,"My hands are shaking from holding back from you, ah, ah, ah",128
25,"All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting",128
26,"My hands are shaking from all this, ah, ah, ah, ah",128
27,Say my name and everything just stops,128
28,I don't want you like a best friend,128
29,Only bought this dress so you could take it off,128
30,"Take it off, ah, ah, ah",128
31,Carve your name into my bedpost,128
32,'Cause I don't want you like a best friend,128
33,Only bought this dress so you could take it off,128
34,"Take it off, ah, ah",128
35,Only bought this dress so you could take it off,128
36,Only bought this dress so you could take it off,128
37,Flashback when you met me,128
38,Your buzzcut and my hair bleached,128
39,"Even in my worst times, you could see the best of me",128
40,Flashback to my mistakes,128
41,"My rebounds, my earthquakes",128
42,"Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me",128
43,And I woke up just in time,128
44,Now I wake up by your side,128
45,"My one and only, my lifeline",128
46,I woke up just in time,128
47,Now I wake up by your side,128
48,"My hands shake, I can't explain this, ah, ah, ah, ah",128
49,Say my name and everything just stops,128
50,I don't want you like a best friend,128
51,Only bought this dress so you could take it off,128
52,"Take it off, ha, ha, ha",128
53,Carve your name into my bedpost,128
54,'Cause I don't want you like a best friend,128
55,Only bought this dress so you could take it off,128
56,"Take it off, ha, ha, ha",128
57,There is an indentation in the shape of you,128
58,Only bought this dress so you could take it off,128
59,"You made your mark on me, golden tattoo",128
60,Only bought this dress so you could take it off,128
