1,It was so nice throwing big parties,129
2,Jumping to the pool from the balcony,129
3,Everyone swimming in a champagne sea,129
4,And there are no rules when you show up here,129
5,Bass beat rattling the chandelier,129
6,Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year,129
7,So why'd you have to rain on my parade?,129
8,I'm shaking my head,129
9,I'm locking the gates,129
10,"This is why we can't have nice things, darling",129
11,Because you break them,129
12,I had to take them away,129
13,"This is why we can't have nice things, honey",129
14,Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?,129
15,This is why we can't have nice things,129
16,It was so nice being friends again,129
17,"There I was, giving you a second chance",129
18,But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand,129
19,And therein lies the issue,129
20,Friends don't try to trick you,129
21,Get you on the phone and mind-twist you,129
22,And so I took an axe to a mended fence,129
23,But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately,129
24,If only you weren't,129
25,So shady,129
26,"This is why we can't have nice things, darling",129
27,Because you break them,129
28,I had to take them away,129
29,"This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Nice things, baby)",129
30,Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?,129
31,This is why we can't have,129
32,Here's a toast to my real friends,129
33,"They don't care about the he said, she said",129
34,And here's to my baby,129
35,He ain't reading what they call me lately,129
36,And here's to my momma,129
37,Had to listen to all this drama,129
38,And here's to you,129
39,'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do,129
40,"Hahaha, I can't even say it with a straight face",129
41,"This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)",129
42,Because you break them,129
43,I had to take them away,129
44,"This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Uh-uh, oh no, baby)",129
45,Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?,129
46,"This is why we can't have nice things, darling (And here's to my real friends)",129
47,Because you break them,129
48,I had to take them (And here's to my baby),129
49,"Nice things, honey (They didn't care about the he said, she said)",129
50,Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?,129
51,This is why we can't have nice things,129
