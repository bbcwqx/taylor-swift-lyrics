1,There's glitter on the floor after the party,131
2,Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby,131
3,Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor,131
4,You and me from the night before but,131
5,Don't read the last page,131
6,But I stay,131
7,When you're lost and I'm scared and you're turning away,131
8,I want your midnights,131
9,But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day,131
10,You squeezed my hand three times in the back of the taxi,131
11,I can tell that it's gonna be a long road,131
12,"I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe",131
13,Or if you strike out and you're crawling home,131
14,Don't read the last page,131
15,But I stay,131
16,When it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes,131
17,I want your midnights,131
18,But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day,131
19,Hold on to the memories,131
20,They will hold on to you,131
21,Hold on to the memories,131
22,They will hold on to you,131
23,Hold on to the memories,131
24,They will hold on to you,131
25,And I will hold on to you,131
26,Please don't ever become a stranger,131
27,Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere,131
28,Please don't ever become a stranger,131
29,Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere,131
30,There's glitter on the floor after the party,131
31,Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby,131
32,Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor,131
33,You and me forevermore,131
34,Don't read the last page,131
35,But I stay,131
36,When it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes,131
37,I want your midnights,131
38,But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day,131
39,Hold on to the memories,131
40,They will hold on to you,131
41,Hold on to the memories,131
42,They will hold on to you,131
43,Hold on to the memories,131
44,They will hold on to you,131
45,And I will hold on to you,131
46,(Please don't ever become a stranger) Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you,131
47,(Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere) Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you,131
48,(Please don't ever become a stranger) Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you,131
49,(Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere) And I will hold on to you,131
