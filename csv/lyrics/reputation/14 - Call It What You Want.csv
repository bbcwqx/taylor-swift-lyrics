1,My castle crumbled overnight,130
2,I brought a knife to a gun fight,130
3,"They took the crown, but it's alright",130
4,All the liars are calling me one,130
5,Nobody's heard from me for months,130
6,I'm doing better than I ever was,130
7,'Cause my baby's fit like a daydream,130
8,Walking with his head down,130
9,I'm the one he's walking to,130
10,"So call it what you want, yeah",130
11,Call it what you want to,130
12,My baby's fly like a jet stream,130
13,High above the whole scene,130
14,Loves me like I'm brand new,130
15,"So call it what you want, yeah",130
16,Call it what you want to,130
17,All my flowers grew back as thorns,130
18,Windows boarded up after the storm,130
19,He built a fire just to keep me warm,130
20,All the drama queens taking swings,130
21,All the jokers dressing up as kings,130
22,They fade to nothing when I look at him,130
23,And I know I make the same mistakes every time,130
24,"Bridges burn, I never learn",130
25,At least I did one thing right,130
26,I did one thing right,130
27,"I'm laughing with my lover, making forts under covers",130
28,Trust him like a brother,130
29,"Yeah, you know I did one thing right",130
30,Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night,130
31,My baby's fit like a daydream,130
32,Walking with his head down,130
33,I'm the one he's walking to,130
34,"So call it what you want, yeah",130
35,Call it what you want to,130
36,My baby's fly like a jet stream,130
37,High above the whole scene,130
38,Loves me like I'm brand new,130
39,"Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it",130
40,"So call it what you want, yeah",130
41,Call it what you want to,130
42,I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck,130
43,Chain 'round my neck,130
44,Not because he owns me,130
45,But 'cause he really knows me,130
46,Which is more than they can say,130
47,I recall late November,130
48,"Holding my breath, slowly I said",130
49,"""You don't need to save me",130
50,"But would you run away with me?""",130
51,"""Yes"" (Would you run away?)",130
52,My baby's fit like a daydream,130
53,Walking with his head down,130
54,I'm the one he's walking to,130
55,"Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it",130
56,"So call it what you want, yeah",130
57,Call it what you want to,130
58,My baby's fly like a jet stream,130
59,High above the whole scene,130
60,Loves me like I'm brand new,130
61,"Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it",130
62,"So call it what you want, yeah",130
63,Call it what you want to,130
64,"Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it",130
65,"Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it",130
66,"Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it",130
67,"Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it",130
68,"Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it",130
69,"Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it",130

71,Call it what you want to,130
